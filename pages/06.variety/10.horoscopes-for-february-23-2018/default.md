_**This Week’s Horoscopes as Things I Love Dearly but Would Never Want to Find as an Image That has Been Toasted onto the Back of My Morning Raspberry Pop-Tart®**_

**_Pisces (Feb. 19 - Mar. 20):_** Jesus Christ

**_Aries (Mar. 21 - Apr. 19):_** Two orders of Santa Fe Mini Chimis from Perkin’s Restaurant and Bakery

**_Taurus (Apr. 20 - May 20):_** Prince, formerly known as The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.

**_Gemini (May 21 - Jun. 20):_** Another morning raspberry Pop-Tart®

**_Cancer (Jun. 21 - Jul. 22):_** A man in uniform

**_Leo (Jul. 23 - Aug. 22):_** C minor/major seven moving to B dominant seven, then E minor.

**_Virgo (Aug. 23 - Sep. 22):_** That scene from _Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End_ where the HMS Endeavor is getting blown to smithereens with cannon fire and Lord Beckett has gone catatonic and is just calmly walking down the stairs to the main deck of the ship while sections of his railing are being blasted off behind him like BLAM BLAM BLAM, and then he steps onto the main deck and walks a few steps and gets enveloped in flame and then the camera zooms out and you can see the ship has been lost due to the combined efforts of our favorite fictional pirates. Like, scientifically accurate or not, that was one hell of an iconic scene and a much cooler way of going out than that snake deserved. I personally thought it was cooler than Jack’s death at the hands of the kraken. But regardless, the day I see that scene as an image that has been toasted onto the back of my morning raspberry Pop-Tart® is a day I dread.

**_Libra (Sep. 23 - Oct. 22):_** Dannon® Oikos® Triple Zero Greek Yogurt, official yogurt of the NFL.

**_Scorpio (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21):_** That moment when a cat bumps their head into you like, “bro.”

**_Sagittarius (Nov 22. - Dec. 21):_** [The Entire Bee Movie Scirpt.](http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/a1/bee-movie-script-transcript-seinfeld.html)

**_Capricorn (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19):_** Mee-maw

**_Aquarius (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18):_** The phrase, “Ken is short for Kenjamin.”
