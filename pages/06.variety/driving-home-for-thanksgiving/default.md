I was driving down to South Dakota for Thanksgiving weekend. My family lives out in the countryside, so whenever I take this annual journey I spend most of it driving down nearly empty highways all night. Usually, it’s a peaceful drive with nothing but my Spotify playlist and a few sodas to keep me company while I drive alone on empty streets all night long. 

But this time while I was driving, I saw a truck maybe a mile ahead of me. That wasn’t too weird out in the country. What was unusual about this truck was that it was going 40 miles per hour on a 70 mile per hour road. The driver didn’t even bother speeding up even when I was tailgating him! Needless to say, I was a tad annoyed with the driver. 

I think the driver knew I was annoyed with him by the way I honked my horn and flashed my high beams at him. Unfortunately, even with these clear signs of annoyance, he didn’t bother to speed up. To make matters worse, we were in a no passing zone so I couldn’t get past this turtle with a driver’s license. 

I tailgated the guy for maybe three miles until we got to a section of road where I could pass him legally. Just my luck, before I could pass him another slow driver was coming the opposite direction, also going 40 miles per hour. I was about to curse both drivers when I saw the guy in front of me flicker his lights at the car coming towards us, who immediately re-sponded by flickering his lights back at him. This puzzled me, but only for a moment until the car drove past both of us. I looked into my rear view mirror and I see him do a U-turn and start speeding up towards us. 

The car didn’t take too long to catch up to us. He slowed down right behind my car, trapping me in between them both. My gut was telling me something bad was about to happen. But I remained calm; I figured as long as I kept driving, they couldn’t do anything to hurt me. 

That was when I noticed something moving in the bed of the truck in front of me. By this point I already had my high beams turned down so all I could see was the outline of what looked like large men in the truck. I decided to flip on my high beams to get a better look and immediately I begin to gag from what I saw. 

Three men were in the bed of this guy’s truck wearing elk hide! I don’t mean elk costumes or pelts, I mean a bloody elk hide from a recently killed elk. My mind couldn’t comprehend what I was seeing, but thank God I saw a turn in the road coming up. 

I made the turn without any hesitation and I sped away from those guys as quickly as I could. I got to the nearest town and spent about an hour there hoping those freaks didn’t try to find me. I honestly don’t know what they were. Where they some dangerous serial killers or some drunk rednecks that like scaring the shit out of people? All I know for sure is that I hope I never see them again.
