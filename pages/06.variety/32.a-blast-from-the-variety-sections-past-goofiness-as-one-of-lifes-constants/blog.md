**By Desmond Homann, Variety Editor** _Originally published in Issue 2, Volume 32 of The University Register on Friday, September 28, 2019_

For those of you who may not know, The University Register has been publishing issues since the 1970’s! Through the years, Variety has been full of all sorts of delightful nonsense, creative writing, and the occasional comic. Unfortunately, it has been a while since we’ve seen a good comic around these parts, so with the help of some encouragement from a Morris alum, I have sifted through the old issues of the UR to find these hilarious comics by Erik Anderson. The comics included here were published in some of the 1988 and 1989 issues of the UR, but are still relevant and quite funny today.

While going down the rabbit-hole of Anderson’s work, I was unable to find much information about the artist himself. It would be, in my opinion, very interesting to learn more about Anderson and whether art stayed a significant part of his life even after his time here at UMM. Of course, if I do happen to come across more information about him or his work in Variety, I will include it in a future issue. Even if I am unable to learn more, this has been a wild opportunity to dig through the UR archives, and I would certainly be open to doing this again.

One thing that I enjoy about both the campus and the community here in Morris is how interconnected everybody is, even after graduating and moving away. We are so lucky to have both community members AND professors who used to be students at UMM. In my time here, one thing that I have learned is that nonsense is a constant in life. Every graduating class has its fair share of goofs, and I would certainly hope that my work with Variety is contributing to Morris’ goofiness. Whoever Erik Anderson is, it is clear that he contributed to this as well!
