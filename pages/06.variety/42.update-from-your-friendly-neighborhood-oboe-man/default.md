As we have begun to settle into this new academic year, we are all learning to adjust our daily habits and routines. Symphonic Winds, like all of us, has had to adapt to the current pandemic.

The students, however, under their conductor Simon Tillier, are meeting the challenge head on by embracing the new social distancing guidelines. This takes a great deal of creative planning, patience, and cooperation. If there is one thing we know already about this year, it is that these students will be able to find success through the close-knit nature of the group. This semester, in order to meet the limitations of our rehearsal spaces, the ensemble is divided in two: a woodwind and percussion orchestra, and a brass and percussion choir. While the latter is a conventional instrumental format, the former is an emerging medium.

The pandemic has affected the livelihood of many musicians and composers, and given the ensemble's collaborative and interdisciplinary past performances, it became a priority to support living composers and the many fine instrumentalists associated with Symphonic Winds. This has given Symphonic Winds a unique opportunity to commision new and adapted works from Jenni Watson and Christopher Hussey, alongside performing other fantastic repertoire by Adam Gorb, William Rimmer, Alexandre Guilmant, Mark Bassey, and Ernesto Lecuona. For those who are already familiar with Symphonic Winds’ recent programs, you may remember Jenni Watson’s three-part composition, States of Matter, which was performed and recorded last year. Students involved with Symphonic Winds got the chance to work directly with Watson, creating a collaborative bond between composer and performer that can stick with a student through and beyond their time in the ensemble. In addition to these commissioned works, there will be opportunities to bring in regional guest artists to collaborate with the ensemble. Again, this will be a beneficial and exciting experience for students involved. 

These initiatives have enabled Symphonic Winds to develop a distinctive approach to meet the challenges of the current situation, and therefore will provide students with new and creative musical experiences, unlike many other universities in Minnesota. Hopefully, being able to practice and perform in smaller groups will also challenge students to grow as musicians and individuals. For the group to be successful, each student will need to put clear effort in and understand their role within the great setting of the ensemble.

The ensemble hopes to be able to film and stream their performances to the campus and the wider community online later in the fall. It's not the same as being able to attend a live performance, but we hope it will stop all of us feeling quite so far apart. Keep an eye out for updates on ways to support the ensemble and view future performances!
