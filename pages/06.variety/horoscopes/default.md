**By Christian Pfeiffer, Editor-in-Chief** _originally published in Issue 3, Volume 30 of the University Register on Friday, October 20, 2017._

**_Libra (Sep. 23 - Oct. 22):_** This week’s mandatory listening is “Sunday Candy” by _Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment_, a jazzy flute solo (store-bought or homemade, both are fine), and the sound of an Italian dropping three pennies into a toilet. It is imperative you do not let the Italian flush.

**_Scorpio (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21):_** Be the cinnamon roll you wish to see in the world. 

**_Sagittarius (Nov 22. - Dec. 21):_** Fall break is over, but your commitment to Sergei is not. Await further instructions at the mattress store on East 7th Street. 

**_Capricorn (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19):_** You’re braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and more combustible than you think. 

**_Aquarius (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18):_** DANCE! 

**_Pisces (Feb. 19 - Mar. 20):_** For a good time, call 1-800-440-0680. 

**_Aries (Mar. 21 - Apr. 19):_** Uranus is in retrograde, and while I have no idea what that means for you, Aries, I think we can both agree that it’s pretty fun to say. 

**_Taurus (Apr. 20 - May 20):_** Try something new this upcoming week. Have you ever open-mouth kissed an employee of the National Football League? (Please note: always ask for permission prior to open-mouth kissing an employee of the National Football League.) 

**_Gemini (May 21 - Jun. 20):_** Mercury’s position in the night sky can’t tell you to invest in AIG, but it also can’t tell you NOT to invest in AIG, and I think your prospects look pretty promising right now. 

**_Cancer (Jun. 21 - Jul. 22):_** Using the list you compiled in the practice assignment on page 137, write a short poem about a childhood experience that you still remember vividly. Exchange your work with a classmate and underline all the words they used that spark an image in your mind’s eye. Compare your work with them afterward to get a better sense of which words are working and which aren’t.
 
**_Leo (Jul. 23 - Aug. 22):_** They’re growing up faster than you think, and while it may never seem like the “right time” to talk to your representatives about gun control, you’ll be glad you did. 

**_Virgo (Aug. 23 - Sep. 22):_** Struggling to think of some good couples costumes for Halloween? Here’s a list to help get you started! 
• Sexy Charles Darwin and Harriet, the Galápagos tortoise he collected in 1835. 
• Sexy Charles Darwin and one of his Galápagos finches. 
• Sexy Charles Darwin and the HMS Beagle. 
• Sexy Charles Darwin and sexy the HMS Beagle. 
• The possibilities are endless!
