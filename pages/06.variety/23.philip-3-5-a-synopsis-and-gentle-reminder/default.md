**By Desmond Homann, Variety Editor** _originally published in Issue 2, Volume 31 of The University Register on September 28, 2018_

Philip: Lover of Horses is a serial exploration of my strong distrust of horses. The first three parts of this atrocity were published last year in some of the later issues of The University Register. As the new Variety Editor, I will continue this story until I get sick of it or until a horse-girl breaks into my home and kills me, whichever comes first. This was not originally intended to be a recurring story, but it looks like we might all be stuck with this for a while. Keep an eye out in upcoming issues for more horse hatred. It should be noted that Philip was very vaguely endorsed, in passing, by both Janet and David Ericksen. It is my understanding that they at least do not dislike this content.

Previously, our poor narrator fumbled his way through two unfortunate interactions with Philip, a man who was just as beautiful as he was crazy. Philip, accompanied by his pride and joy, a horse named Sapphire, tried his best to understand why the narrator keeps avoiding him. It appeared he did not realize just how gross and horrific horses truly are.

The third part of this ridiculous series revealed a new lover, Caspian, and a whole new set of problems. I can promise more horses, more nonsense, and maybe even more Philip in the somewhat-near future. What I cannot promise, however, is that I will get over this idiotic fear. Sure, I may have just recently met a sane horse-girl, but that doesn’t even minutely reduce the amount of dread I fear when a horse looks directly into my soul.

It is highly recommended that, before I get around to finishing up the fourth part, readers stop by the University Register’s website to skim through the first three installations once more.
