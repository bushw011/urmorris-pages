Hey all! My name’s Jon and this issue, and only for this issue, I am going to be writing Dad’s Fried Potatoes. Demcie is letting me write this because, not only am I the Variety Editor, but also the President of History Club, and this week Histor Club had a very successful bake sale. One of the most popular items we made were cookie pies. It’s a pie with dough-consistency cookie filling which means that it’s like eating cookie dough, but its fully cooked! Without further ado, let’s jump into this recipe!

Time: 60 minutes

Ingredients:
½ cup granulated sugar
½ cup flour
½ cup brown sugar
¾ cup softened butter (1 ½ sticks)
2 large eggs
10” deep dish pie crust (frozen)
1 cup chocolate chips
1 cup M&Ms (equal to one regular-sized packet you would find at a cash register)

Directions:

1. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. 
2. Beat the eggs until they begin to foam. I would using an electric mixer, otherwise you will hate your hands by the time it begins to foam.3. 
3. Combine the granulated sugar, flour, and brown sugar with the foamy eggs until they become a consistency comparable to the books at the Library of Alexandria (i.e. dirt and ash).
4. Next, add the butter to the bowl of dirt. The mixture will soften.
5. Using a spatula, fold the chocolate chips and M&Ms into the pie-filling mixture.
6. Pour the pie-filling into the still-frozen pie crust and cook it for 55-60 minutes, or until you are able to stick a knife into the filling between the center of the pie and the edge, pull it out, and not have any pie-filling stuck to the blade.
7. Let cool and enjoy with a nice dollop of whip cream! (20 extra points if you made the whip cream yourself)

This pie honestly tastes like cookie dough and it is one of my favorite recipes I have ever made ever in my life. To reiterate, this will be the only time I write “Dad’s Fried Potatoes” because Demcie said I could tell you all History Club’s great cookie pie recipe. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to shove my face into a cookie pie, and I hope you do so as well.
