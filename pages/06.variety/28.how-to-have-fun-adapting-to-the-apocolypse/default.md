Ominous cowbells loomed in the front of the Cow Palace as Tupac blared on the display. People were lined up for Rat Skewers, Toxic Waste, and Pigs in Radiation Blankets, snacks before the main event. It was time to learn How to Have Fun Adapting to the Apocalypse, and also learn about UMM’s brand new Sustainability Leadership minor.
    
Simon Franco introduced the event with a classic one-liner: “Of course we’re a green campus: I just bought a Tahoe.” Laughter. After talking briefly about his sustainability journey in Morris, how “sustainability is taking only what you need” and how thankful he was for his Tahoe, he turned it over to Clement Loo and Sandy Olson-Loy, Vice Chancellor of student affairs. The duo spoke a bit about their relationship with sustainability and how Morris is one of the leading schools in the nation for sustainability. Everything pointed towards this being a normal-ish lecture...
    
BAM. END OF THE WORLD BY R.E.M. STARTS PLAYING. Everyone got up and danced (or got more food if they weren’t into that).
    
After that, Troy Goodnough introduced several guest speakers and students to talk about sustainability at UMM to encourage students to look out for the minor: Andrew Brichacek, former MCSA President, William Chinana and Abbey Dickhudt, leaders of the gardening club on campus and sustainability leaders, resident meme-queen and sustainability expert Sydney Bauer, as well as UMM Alumni Keni Zenner, who spent time studying abroad. These leaders offered both informative and hilarious anecdotes about their experiences with sustainability at UMM, and how those experiences will help them in the future. One common thread through all of their presentations was that sustainability is ongoing, and it is incredibly important.
    
“There are many important parts of sustainability,” Jules Burke, a student worker at the Office of Sustainability and all-around sustainable student, told us, “but my most important one is making sure that the next people in my place can do my work as well or better than I can. Making sure that any process to build sustainability in a community can be picked up by anyone with or without mentoring.”
    
After these presentations, we got up and danced again to some more catchy music. A little awkward the second time, but a welcome pacebreaker, which was immediately followed by an absolutely phenomenal improv show, performed by UMM’s very own Breakfast for Dinner and Sports Team improv troupes. Their theme, “Apocalypse,” was handled hilariously, beginning with Good, Bad, Terrible advice, including “throw yourself to the zombies, who cares anyway?” and many references to Indiana Jones and cannibalism, following that up with a signature montage of skits involving Zombie Fan-Clubs, living inside a giraffe, making the most out of what limited food you have, and apocalyptic breakups. The audience was hooting and hollering the whole time. 
	
“I think it was clever to have an apocalypse-themed improv show,” Mikayla Cook, a member of Sports Team, told us. “Trying to stick to a sustainability-centered scene was pretty quickly tossed aside in favor of zombie jokes, which I was a fan of.” Mikayla also had a comment about how Morris is so sustainable, it’s even somewhat comical.

“I hear at least a joke a day about the town's recycling fetish.”

Closing with clips from Terminator 2, Mad Max: Fury Road, and Apocalypse Now, Goodnough asked all the panelists about what was wrong with these apocalyptic scenes. While normal answers were given, such as “nuclear fallout, rapid climate change, and threat of imminent war,” Goodnough cheekily responded with “No natural play area for children in that playground, spraying your teeth with paint thinner,” and “the best smell in the morning is in fact not napalm, but gasoline.” Truly a remarkable way to close the event.

The sustainability minor rolls out Fall 2019.
