**By Desmond Homann, Variety Editor** _Originally published in Issue 6, Volume 32 of The University Register on Friday, November 22, 2019_

The conversation from the other night became a bit of a distraction the next two days, and I found the margins of my notes decorated with doodles of eyes and teeth, clawing hands extending through storm drains, and clouds of billowing smoke rising into the night sky. To be fair, I had let my imagination run wild over what seemed to be nothing more than rural wildlife. That being said, I had been wondering: how could my professor hint at this “energy” so ominously yet also so nonchalantly? In classes, I perceived Angela as being a very straight-forward person, which could have been why she could make such supernatural implications so calmly.

Today was my chance to confront her about this, though, and I was unbearably curious. Ridiculously impatient, I rushed to the Humanities building before 2 p.m. hit, scurrying up the stairs and nearly flattening two other students on my way to the second floor. Before I could catch my breath and raise an arm to knock on the door, it swung open to reveal one very excited Angela Hume.

“Ah, thanks for stopping by! I was hoping to hear from you. Come in!”

I mumbled some unnecessary apology for visiting so early, but Angela didn’t hear me, as she had already moved on to what I hoped would be the explanation I had been looking for.

“It’s quite interesting that I ran into you the other day, though I’m not too surprised. I happened to be in the area and I was curious to see if it would be around as well. Timing seems to be on my side lately... or maybe just barely working against me. I keep missing it just by moment, but I get closer every time. I knew that if anybody else was looking into, well, that thing, it could likely be you. Maybe you’ve seen more than me already; I can absolutely see you taking this up as a bit of a side project. I’m sorry, you have seen it, right?”

If Angela had been leaning any further forward in her chair, she may have ended up on the floor. All of her words were flying at me at a speed that I simply could not keep up with, and I was sure that I was staring blankly at Angela as if this was only my third time hearing the English language. This was already the point in the semester where my two brain cells were dinging around inside my head like an old Windows screensaver, and it showed. After a moment of mentally smashing together the words I was looking for, I told Angela the truth.

“I’m not sure what you mean, actually. All I know is that I was on my way home from work and was interrupted by what might be a really sick stray cat. I let my imagination weave some silly story together, but I don’t know what else to tell you,” I apologized again, still unclear on what this project was that I had supposedly been sucked into.

“Maybe this will help. It’s all I have right now,” she offered, searching through her phone.

Angela turned her phone to face me, and I didn’t know whether to laugh or be genuinely frightened. I was finding myself face-to-face with what appeared to be a dark, grainy version of the stereotypical Bigfoot picture. The creature pictured was doing the classic Bigfoot pose, which made the whole thing feel incredibly staged, but I didn’t think that Anglea was the kind of person to photoshop this blurry little Creature from the Black Lagoon sort of fellow.

“I didn’t take this picture and I don’t know how it ended up on my phone, but I have some vague memories of seeing this somewhere. I don’t know  what it is, but I feel confident that this is real. I can’t confirm this yet, but I’ve been sensing some sort of radical feminist energy in town lately. I have some questions for the source of this possible feminist vigilante. Do you think the costume is to remain anonymous, or do you think...hmm.”

“Well,” I slowly replied, trying to offer whatever help I could in investigating this person or creature, “you said you just barely miss it, right? Your timing is just a bit off? What if you brought me along next time you look for it and I trailed along at a distance or something; would that work?”

“Another set of eyes couldn’t hurt! We could even go look as soon as my office hours end. We would have to head to...maybe the alley near Mi Mexico? I really do have this person’s schedule down at this point. It’s nothing creepy, I just want to get involved, especially if this is an art project of sorts!”

I cautiously agreed to accompany Angela to peek into storm drains. The whole thing still sounded silly to me, but I wouldn’t really consider Angela a prankster or anything similar (This is not an insult in any way, simply an observation). 

Winter was approaching, so the sun had already begun to set by the time I made my way towards town. I couldn’t wrap my head around what we were doing. I hoped we weren’t actually stalking this costumed person and I hoped that this person wasn’t truly spending time in the sewers. The suspicious stillness in the air seemed to agree with me, and I grew more uneasy with each step. Ahead of me I could see Angela already strolling through the alley, focused intensely with her eyes on the
ground. I hurried to her side.

We weren’t the only ones around, and I made sure to take careful notice of the two others nearby. These two women were chatting beside a parked car, and judging by the take-out boxes in their hands, they were just leaving a pleasant dinner. Again I grew self-conscious about looking a bit suspicious lurking by an overflowing recycling bin behind a restaurant.

“So, what now?”

Before I could hear an answer, I was interrupted by the engine of a rusty red pickup truck with an unsavory political sticker on the bumper. The truck was passing through the alley, but slowed to a halt near both us and the row of parked cars. The man inside the window slowly rolled down his window, leaning out towards the women with a smug laugh. The following comment that he made is not something that I can comfortably repeat here, but the words that he spat at the women left me disgusted but not surprised. I’ll leave this up to you to envision what he may have yelled. Angela, on the other hand, was not ready to let anybody get away with such slimy remarks. 

Eyes bright with rage, she clenched her fists and shouted, “HEY! YOU CANNOT SAY THAT TO THEM!”

Now frustrated, the man emerged from his truck, slamming the door behind him. 

“You’ve got a problem with something?” He grunted, approaching quickly.

I turned in fear, watching Anglea’s reaction. Strangely enough, she seemed to have grown taller, but maybe that was just her assertive presence. No, wait, she certainly was taller and seemed to be growing taller still! Before my eyes, I watched as my professor gained almost a foot in height, an even angrier expression than before, and...a faint green tinge to her skin. In this moment, I think I began to piece together what was going on. As Angela reached behind us, pulling a wine bottle from the recycling bin, I thought I caught a glimpse of what appeared to be scales on her hand. Perhaps she was right all along. There was a powerful feminist energy in town, and I should have seen it sooner.

The abrasive man was growing dangerously close, and as he closed the gap he let one more comment fly. Swiftly, I saw Angela’s arm rise, swinging the bottle into the air. There were only two words spoken:

“VIBE CHECK!”

The man turned and bolted back into the safety of his truck, leaving at an amazing speed, and for good reasons. The person standing beside me no longer looked like Angela Hume, though she was not fully the creature I had seen in the image. From the olive-green scales to the shining, void-black claws, this being had become herself again and the puzzle pieces snapped into place for good.

I pulled out my phone to snap a picture, worried that Angela may not be aware, as that seemed to be the issue before.

“That won’t be necessary,” she quietly assured me.

Angela, shockingly still, gently placed the bottle back into the bin that it had come from.

“I wouldn’t have hit him, but...direct action. I couldn’t be silent.”

I was speechless, the women were in the process of leaving in confusion and fear, and the air was quiet once more.

“This answers some of my questions, I suppose, but I need to do some thinking. Maybe I should head home. Or maybe I’ll head into the sewers... apparently that’s something I’ve been doing. Yeah, I’m going to go claim the sewers as a hub of angry queer feminist energy, right? Someone has to do it.”

I still had no words, but fully trusted Angela’s judgement now more than ever. I smiled in agreement and prepared to head back home. 

“And Desmond? Don’t forget, you have an ally below the town now.”

She was right. I did not fear for the safety of the people of Morris. After all, we have our own secret hero now.
