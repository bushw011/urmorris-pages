I picked up my latte and moved to an outdoor table at the cafe. My date, who I had met on some dumb dating app, had informed me that he was running a bit late, but had a very romantic surprise that would definitely make up for it. As could be expected, I was more than a bit wary. In addition to his very cryptic message, I was hesitant about making plans, as it was Valentine’s Day. I’ve always spent this fake holiday alone. In fact, even if I wanted to spend it with another person, there’s no way I would have picked today to meet up with a stranger. Philip was an exception. Philip was incredibly lucky that he had his good looks going for him. He was beautiful, or at least his pictures were. Philip had these luscious blonde curls and the warmest brown eyes I had ever seen. I was attracted to him instantly, and when he asked to grab coffee, I was caught off guard. How could someone like him be interested in someone like me? It was almost too good to be true.

Was it? Could it be too good to be true? I sipped my hot drink as the syrupy wave of second thoughts and second-guessing bubbled through my body. What if Philip was one of those freak dates you hear of who invite someone back to their place, just to redecorate the apartment with their guts? What if Philip was in fact a 60-year old man who stole some undiscovered model’s photos? What if Philip revealed through small talk that he’s some sort of openly racist, disgusting, self centered—oh! My phone buzzed, the mystery man’s name appearing on my screen.

“I’m almost there. I can’t wait to see the look on your adorable face when you see the surprise I have for you,” the text read. He ended his message with a heart. Maybe he wasn’t crazy. Maybe he was just amazingly beautiful and generous and picked up a gift for me on his way. Maybe he was perfect. I adjusted my tie and tried to keep my wits about me. Philip and I had been talking for about two weeks now, although I suppose it was me who did all the talking. It wasn’t that he was boring or unintelligent, but he didn’t share many details about his life. In fact, I don’t think he ever told me what he does for a living. Being the extroverted person I am, I overshared every little detail of my life, from losing my keys and running into my ex at the store to finding $20 in a pair of pants I don’t wear often. Philip just liked to compliment me and make small talk about music and TV shows. There came another buzz and my heart sped up yet again.

“Keep an eye out for me… we’re now only minutes apart…”

This message had a very different feeling from the last. This message seemed to ooze from the phone and my stomach dropped as my eyes crawled over each word once again. The seconds fell away, and I felt like my body was collapsing in on itself. 

It was then that I heard it, an awful clicking coming from around the corner. I knew that sound all too well, as there was only one thing I feared most of all. Each click grew louder and louder, eventually covering the pounding of my heart. Just as I feared, a horse came trudging around the corner, its dead eyes taking in the terror on my face. The monstrosity turned its head towards me as it approached, and I looked into the eyes of something that, for all I know, could have been some kind of eldritch horror. The beast’s lips curled back, and as its disgustingly long teeth were displayed, it let out a bone-shaking whinny. I bolted, not looking back to check the accuracy of Philip’s beautiful pictures. I should have known. Everyone knows that all Philips love horses; even the name Philip means ‘lover of horses’. Where did I go wrong? How could I have let this happen? I should have known.
