**By Jon Antonsen, Variety Editor** _uploaded at 2:35 p.m. on Saturday, February 10, 2018._

I had a routine. First, I woke up around 11. I would grab the People magazine (stolen from Briggs) by my bed, flip to one of those deodorant advertisements, and rub the sample on my pits. Chew a stick of Trident Fresh Mint. Put on my outfit of the day (I had a different one for each day, however they were seldom washed). Grab my 70-sheet Mead notebook—red colored—and a pencil—also red and covered in teeth marks.

I could have never take an 8 a.m., that would have been impossible; _IT_ knocks you out for at least 12 hours. For me, those hours were between 11 p.m. and 11 a.m.

During my classes, the professor spoke but I never listened. I was always planning my next pick-up. Did he say to meet him near the grill outside Pine? Or was it Indy? Which grill? How will I know its him?

Each day it was a different guy. I never knew what happened to the guys from the previous day. I think it’s a rotation. That would make sense; sometimes campus police would take them in, other times a rival dealer killed them. It was to protect the trade. This is the next thing.

After I picked up the stuff, there were two spots I liked: the 24-hour computer lounge in the basement of Imholte and Bathroom 103 in the HFA. Those places are the least travelled on campus. Well, that was until Shelia found me in the 24-hour computer lounge—she freaked out. Couldn’t go there anymore. In fact, I can’t go anywhere anymore.

It was a Wednesday, 8 p.m., and I decided to go early. I had a meeting with my study group in the morning. I wasn’t planning on showing up, but this time I had to—Shelia was the one who organized it. I don’t want her to suspect anything because she threatened to call campus police on me next time she caught me. Gotta stay focused, gotta get high.

I loaded my equipment into my backpack. It looked a little awkward, however I just explained that the bulge in my backpack is a horn. Of what type? I don’t know; no one usually follows up.

I entered the HFA from the Proscenium door. I casually strolled past the theater folks in the pit. I jumped when a group of people surprised me from the multipurpose rehearsal room near the IT wing. They probably thought I was weird, but I don’t care; I need my fix.

I entered the bathroom—room 103. I closed the door and locked it, stuffing my flannel shirt into the crevice under the door. “I am ready,” I said.
I unzipped my backpack and pulled the cardboard box from its gullet. Carefully, I lifted the tabs on the corners of the box and flipped the lid open. There it was, my baby: a 2-quart Kitchenaid vegetable juicer.

Excited, I gripped its handles and set it on the sink. I plugged in its 3-pronged connector to the bathroom outlet. I tested it to make sure it still worked. She purred at me with anticipation.

From my backpack, I pulled out my vice, my fix, my drug, my lover: freshly cut sticks of celery.

Quickly, I tossed them into the juicer, put the spout in my mouth, and started it. I could feel my Kitchenaid spill out the wonderful liquid. As the lot of celery inside the juicer disappeared, I loaded it again. The soothing liquid spilled down my throat like a river flows gracefully through a mountain.

“Yes!” I screamed, “Yes, I want more!”

Suddenly I heard a knock. As quickly as it had arrived, my ecstasy vanished and my eyes widened with fear.

“Joseph!” The knocker yelled. The voice sounded familiar. “Joseph! What the hell are you doing? You’re ruining your life!”


It was Shelia.

I shut off my Kitchenaid, scrambling to pack it up.

“Uh, its not what you think!” I yelled back. I’m screwed.

I threw the celery into my backpack, grabbed my flannel, and began to wash my hands. “I was, uhh, masturbating! Yeah, masturbating!”

Shelia wasn’t convinced. “You get out here right now!”

I grabbed a paper towel, patted down my hands, and rushed outside.

There she was. Her red hair hung in curls down her soft cheeks, almost covering her blue eyes. Her hands, so small and soft, were curled up in powerful fists. Her legs and her luscious thighs quivered with anger. She was wearing an Acid King t-shirt—the one I bought her at Doomfest 2016. She looked beautiful. But we were just friends… until that day. 

“Damn it Joseph! You can’t do this to yourself, you need help!” She scolded. 

I tried to play dumb, “I don’t know what you’re talking about—” 

“Hey, shithead! You can’t keep living like this… I care about you!” 

She was mad, and I knew that. But I knew she cared for me. After a few moments of silence, my bottom lip began to quiver, and I felt tears well in my eyes. 

She hugged me, then whispered “I love you, man.” 

I began to cry and whispered back, “I love you, too.” 

She brought me back to her dorm in Gay Hall (Author’s note: Gay is bae) and we talked for a few hours about my problem, about treatment options, and about my life. I left at 4 a.m. 

I’ve been clean for 3 months now and I am in a happy relationship with Shelia. 

But leaving celery was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. 

Say “no” to celery.
