_**Aquarius (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18):**_ Let’s take a step back for a minute. Have you ever questioned just where your “zodiac sign” comes from? 
The “zodiac” was an ancient tool used for dividing up the night sky into 12 smaller, easy-to-manage portions, like Scorpio, Gemini, etc. 
Webster’s Dictionary defines a “sign” as “something indicating the presence or existence of something else,” like how we kids knew our parents’ marriage was struggle when my mom started driving on the rumble strips for miles at a time. 

_**Pisces (Feb. 19 - Mar. 20):**_ Stop going after bad boys. Y’know who you’re gonna be glad you’ve spent a decade of your life with down the road? Craig, the brave man who never committed tax fraud.

**_Aries (Mar. 21 - Apr. 19):_** Hey, tiger. I know you’re stressed, but don’t worry, it’ll be okay. A few centuries from now, the alien overlords won’t even know what a Snapchat story is. They’ll just want ever-increasing quantities of human organic matter, and that’ll be your descendants’ problem, not yours.

_**Taurus (Apr. 20 - May 20):**_ You are loved. I mean, don’t get me wrong, statistically speaking there is a far greater number of people who are completely indifferent about you than there are people who love you. I mean, it’s what, 7.4 billion to what, like maybe the 500 of your Facebook friends you actually know? That’s like the number of people who care about you multiplied by like, 15 m-i-l-l-i-o-n. And, come to think of it, even of the people you do know, there’s probably a handful of people who range from mildly disliking you to full-on hating you. So it’s actually even a little less than one person per every 15 million people who loves you. That’s DEPRESSING! But, y’know, love is strong stuff, so have faith—I mean, it did cap Voldemort’s crinkly pale ass.

**_Gemini (May 21 - Jun. 20):_** Cleanliness is next to scrubbedness.

**_Cancer (Jun. 21 - Jul. 22):_** This week’s mandatory listening is “If You Were Here” by the Thompson Twins, a clarinetist impersonating a seagull (with or without their clarinet), and some mindless water cooler twattling from the hoi polloi.

**_Leo (Jul. 23 - Aug. 22):_** Flatbread is overrated. It is less bread for the same price as more bread, and I blame unrealistic beauty standards. Thicc bread is beautiful bread. 1 retweet = 1 amen.

_**Virgo (Aug. 23 - Sep. 22):**_ Venus and Mars aren’t talking right now. Like, to me. They still talk to each other. (I assume.) But the point is, I don’t know what wisdom, if any, they want me to pass onto you. I’m sorry; I shouldn’t have burnt that effigy. And I definitely shouldn’t have been wearing real fur while I did it. And I for sure shouldn’t have eaten more that the recommended dose of Flintstones vitamin gummies that day. But y’know, you live, you learn.

_**Libra (Sep. 23 - Oct. 22):**_ Happy Adobe-Flash-Player-is-out-of-date Day! The University Register would like to wish you and your family a safe and fun-filled update from Adobe!

**_Scorpio (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21):_** Much like my first semester on antidepressants, the word “wildebeest” does not have an “a” in it. The takeaway here is that you don’t need an “a” to participate in a large, yearly migration from Tanzania to Kenya.

_**Sagittarius (Nov 22. - Dec. 21):**_ Sweetie, I love the spirit, but you can go ahead and dial it back a notch now. Some of us have hangovers.

_**Capricorn (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19):**_ I know you had to do it to em. You were in the right.
