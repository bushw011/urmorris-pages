Serahsohta always smelled like motor oil. It didn’t make sense why; maybe it was the constant rush of cars passing through a ghost town; maybe it was the constant whirr and hum of excavators or forklifts over at the junkyard; or maybe, just maybe, there was a constant and ever-present gas leak. Either way, Crass scrunched his nose and pushed up his glasses. One thing he hated about Serahsohta; it was always too damn hot, from May through September, blistering heat. But, since he’d ‘grown used to it’, he suffered through.

Crass hadn’t even stopped by his home yet. He knew his mom would want to smother him in hugs and barrage him with questions about university, but he had a few other things to attend to first. He kept noticing little cracks in the sidewalk and the streets, grass and weeds springing indiscriminately, which Crass definitely didn’t remember.

All of the buildings he passed—Smith’s Bar, the old Union bank, and the laundromat run by his old neighbors—all faded into one another, stained with age. He wondered if he ran up and tapped the walls if they’d collapse.

The dilapidated fence that surrounded Chramer’s Trash Depot had degraded even further into disrepair since Crass last saw it. What once was a proud chain-link fence in middle school was now a confused tangle of rust that linked together incoherently. The welcome center for people looking to dump had a shattered window held together with duct tape and plywood, and the paint job had begun to flake off in large, garish patches. The junk pit. So many summers and winters spent toiling away in the back of the pit. He and his coworkers would dig and toss, shoveling all sorts of familiar scrap and crap. He wasn’t a tinkerer, but he knew some people were. Crass took a deep breath: vaguely rancid, familiar. A wave of nostalgia washed over him. Even after a year away, he still wondered where he’d be if he stayed in this—literal—dump. He knew the answer, deep down. Before he could take another step into the pit, he found a pair of tanned, hairy arms wrapping around his neck.

“Well, we ain’t seen you ‘round here in a while!” a familiar, guttural voice shouted in his ear. Crass wrestled the arms from his neck, keeping careful attention to not scuff his polo. Twisting around, a buck-toothed man with greasy hair stared straight at Crass.

“Terry?” Crass asked. “Is that you?”

“Course it is, Crass!” he said, chuckling and brazenly playing with his overalls. “Who’d ya think it was? Dont’cha recognize me?”

“I did, but...how long was I gone?”

“Still got that sense of humor, I see,” Terry said. He slid an arm around Crass’s shoulder, and the foul stench of grease and B.O. became even more apparent. Crass squirmed as he tried to get away from Terry’s second attempt at a welcoming hug. Once the surprise of seeing a familiar face went away, he relaxed a bit. 

“So....uh, what are you doing here, Terry?”

“You done forgot already? It’s Sunday! I work today! Junk pit ain’t gonna sort itself!”

“Right! Sorry, it’s been a while.”

“Hasn’t been that long, man.”

Terry took Crass by the arm and dragged him around the pit. A few familiar faces: Old Earl, Steve Harris, Clem. But mostly new faces. Crass waved nervously to the newcomers, but they didn’t wave back. He carefully minded each step he took; he didn’t want to get his shoes overly dirty. A little scuffed with mud, sure, but not the rancid remains of people’s garbage and some leather, like his last pair. In between watching his feet and figuring out when he’d finally get a chance to end this awkward interaction, Terry broke the silence.

“So, Crass, watchu been learnin’ out there in Layton?”

“Just...studying business, that sort of thing. I think I’ve got a knack for it, at least that’s what my teachers tell me.”

“Really?” Terry said, disappointment dripping from his lips.

“There’s nothin’ out there we couldn’ta taught you here.”

“I doubt that, Terry,” Crass said. He scrunched up his nose. Too many intermingling smells. The rot of trash and Terry’s mix of body spray and natural funk started to make Crass’s eyes water. He wiped under his glasses. “So...how’s papa Terry?”

“He’s out ‘n’ about,” Terry shrugged. “Ain’t been around much. Didn’t know you was comin’ back, neither.”

“It’s not like I was going to die, Terry. I was just going to college!”

Terry grumbled something incoherent under his breath. Crass couldn’t quite make it out, but he knew Terry wasn’t pleased. Frankly, neither was Crass. Terry’s grimy shirt clung to Crass’s. For a minute, it reminded him of the good old days: him and Terry toiling in the pit, cleaning up, cracking jokes, having a good time. As Crass got older, those times began to be more and more distant. And then—Terry wheeled Crass back to a tiny corner of the junkyard, somehow pristine, untouched by garbage or filth. In the center of it all was a little chunk of metal and plastic. Crass recognized it immediately.

“Still fuddling with that little piece of machinery?”

“That I am, Crass,” Terry nodded, moving to toy with it. His legs noticeably crunched as he bent over to pick it up. “Still don’t know what it’s for, though.”

“God, I remember that. You and I used to spend our breaks just spinning it in our hands.”

“Might as well have been a toy! I think I’ve made some progress on it, but ol’ Clem had me help him fix up some old rigs that people brought in. Call me ‘Fix ‘er Up Terry!’” 

The two shared a chuckle. For a moment, everything seemed right. This was their pit; the two of them used to sneak away and relax here, and just tinker and mess with this odd little chunk of trash. Crass had begun his life, and Terry had realized his. Everything, for a second, was perfect. Terry’s face, soft, now hardened into a frown.

“Hey, Crass?”

“Yeah?”

“You know how people can still tell you’re from Serahsohta?”

“How?”

“You say ‘fuddlin’.”

“What?”

“Ain’t nobody from the big city uses ‘fuddlin’ in their words. You still belong here.”

The words stung. Crass had inadvertently let himself fall vulnerable for a moment. He realized, right then and there, Terry’s plan. He winced, but knew what had to be said. 

“Terry, I’m not coming back.”

“Why?”

“Because,” Crass said, “I finally have a way out! I can go on and do bigger things!”

Terry threw the object to the ground, uncaring of its existence, and grabbed Crass by the collar. 

“We was family, Crass. You ‘n’ me. We were the Junkyard Duo, and now you think just cause you’re gettin’ a fancy pants degree, you can just skip town on us?”
“I’m not like you! I wasn’t made for this place!”

“That’s not true! You worked here harder than any of us! Why’d you leave?!”

Crass threw Terry’s hands off of him. He fixed his shirt. The space between them grew. 

“I hate the smell here.”

“Big city smog ain’t no different.”

“What was I supposed to do, Terry? Stay?”

“Yes! You were!” Terry shouted. He tried straightening his long, unkept hair with his hands, greasy from work. “You just up and left me!”

“And you didn’t want to come with me! You didn’t even try, Terry.”

“I...I’m not...”

Terry stayed silent for a moment. Crass could tell he was hurt. Terry started sputtering, a car engine refusing to start and fight back. Crass turned his back, and began to leave the junkyard. 

“I still have the notebook you gave me, Terry. After our last fight?”

“Y-yeah, and?”

“It’s filled up now,” Crass said. “I still thank you for it in my head, every time I use it.”

Crass began to walk to his family’s house. It may have always been too damn hot in Serahsohta, but at least at his parent’s house he could turn on the AC, sit in his favorite chair, and think in the silent comfort of his living room.
