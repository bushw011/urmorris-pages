You were always the kind of person who works best with music on, each playlist specifically curated to keep you as focused as possible. Every once in a while, though, you’d stray from the path of these carefully hand-picked playlists, letting a recommendation or forgotten favorite crawl up through the floorboards. You rarely let this bother you, occasionally trapping these curious creatures and sewing them into existing playlists, another voice added to the heap.

You put a hand to your stomach; you were a bit of a paranoid person to begin with, but in this moment you felt like a stranger in your own home. The song washed over you and clung like seaweed, drying quickly as it came to an end so you could barely pick it off of your skin, still chilled.
