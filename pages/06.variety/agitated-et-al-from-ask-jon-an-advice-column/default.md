> Dear Jon,

> Thanksgiving is coming up and I always seem to disappoint my family with my homemade dinner. Do you have any cooking tips I could use? Like, how do I get my PS4 to a nice, golden brown? I always end up overcooking it to the point where it just gets too tough and burnt to eat. And then I always find myself struggling with stuffing. I find that making it from scratch is too difficult, but I have serious ethical objections to using pre-made stuffing from a box or a bag; namely, how can I present to my family a dish labeled “stuffing” when, after I remove it from its container, it ceases to be stuffing anything?

Dear Agitated, et al.,

That sounds like quite the problem! When I cook my PS4, I always do a little prep work first. I am assuming you are a student at the University of Minnesota Morris. Go to Briggs Library and check out the book Medical Mineralogy and Geochemistry (Call number QP533 .M43 2006) and tear out a few pages. You only need enough to cover the PS4 with one layer of pages. After this, douse it in paprika oil and sawdust to give it a nice crust. Next, preheat your oven to 550 degrees Fahrenheit and bake the PS4 for 32 minutes exactly. After it is done cooking, unwrap the PS$ from its flavor cocoon and enjoy. Here’s another plus: the flavor cocoon can be used as stuffing! Just add some water, and there ya go!
