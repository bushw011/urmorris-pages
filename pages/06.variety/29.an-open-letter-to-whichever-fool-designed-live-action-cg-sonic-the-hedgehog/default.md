Dear God, director Jeff Fowler, and a Mr. Sonic T. Hedgehog,

What in the actual hell were you thinking?

Sorry, let me rephrase that. What in the actual literal god-forsaken hell were you thinking?! 

To a Mr. Sonic T. Hedgehog, I don’t understand why you’d let them represent your character like this. For one, he looks creepy. He looks like a pharmaceutical mascot for hemorrhoids. He looks like he should be speeding up to me with his bootlegged red Timbs and saying “Hey! Have no fear! Hemmo-X knocks out your hemorrhaging faster than I can run! Gotta blast!” I can’t. This is not the Sonic we know and love. You let yourself get bootlegged. This isn’t like Rocketman where Taron Egerton was a good fit for Elton John, this isn’t Bohemian Rhapsody where Rami Malek played an okay Freddie Mercury. No. This is a monstrosity. You’ve let yourself fall so far from grace, Mr. Hedgehog. Hell, you even let them base you off your Sonic The Hedgehog (2006) design, which already spells trouble. That was not your worst game (cough Colors cough) but that wasn’t a step in the right direction. We didn’t need to reboot your franchise again. You were on the right track, man. We had “Sonic Mania”, you were finally, FINALLY good again. But no. You let this happen. Well, this and Forces. I’m onto you, Sonic. I’m watching you burn your own franchise to the ground.

To director Jeff Fowler, you’ve got another thing coming, buster. We were finally on track to making some good progress in the gaming community for movies. “Alita: Battle Angel” (yes it’s anime but whatever) was amazing, and proves that directors can take source material and adapt it for a great audience. Heck, movies like “Wreck-it-Ralph” handled games better than you have so far. All I knew at first going into this movie was that Jim Carrey was going to be Eggman. Weird flex, but okay. Then you had to go and show the movie poster with his disproportionate-ass legs and hyper-realistic shoes. You really didn’t want people to see this movie, huh? Those legs were the meme of the month, Fowler. And now, this. The official design. I don’t even want to see it in motion. He looks like he’s going to eat me, my children, and my children’s children. He belongs in “The Conjuring”, or “Paranormal Activity”, not in your gritty Sonic reboot. I pray to God you didn’t take off his shoes for a Sonic Feet gag. I think you’d scar an entire generation of twenty-somethings, and force an entire generation of children to never want to touch a Sonic game ever. I worry for you, burning the good integrity of Mr. Sonic like he’s a Friday-night joint.

To God himself...why?

Yours Truly,
