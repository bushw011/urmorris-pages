Sunday, November 3 at 3 p.m. the Morris Symphonic Winds will be holding their second concert of the semester, Life in the Groove. This concert is open to the public and free to attend. This concert’s program includes pieces that reflect the influence of jazz music on wind bands, with the various pieces ranging from standard to more contemporary. All six selections in the program feature solos from Morris students and faculty. One of these solos will be performed by jazz director Jonathan Campbell, who will play tenor saxophone in “En Memoria de Chano Pozo”. The main featured piece is “Blue Shades” by Frank Ticheli, which includes a notable clarinet solo by UMM junior Madison Grimsbo.

One thing that makes Life in the Groove unique is the collaboration with visiting conductor and educator Dr. Milt Allen. Allen will be joint-conducting this program with Symphonic Winds director Simon Tillier as well as teaching several clinics and workshops at local schools during his week here. Symphonic Winds received support from NASS in bringing Allen to campus, demonstrating the importance of collaboration between different groups on campus and in the community. Milt Allen was asked to visit primarily because of his advocacy of music for everyone. His engaging personality is sure to make him a good fit for the ensemble. Additionally, this program was influenced by him, as conductors tend to have sets of programs they come back to and build upon.

There is much that the performers, the local schools, the campus, and the community can gain from having a visiting educator. This is a wonderful opportunity for people to see a unique conductor at work. According to Tillier, “There is a certain exuberance and passion that he has on the podium. He is a crazy guy in the best way. You’ll never forget meeting him.” Because this concert is free to the public, this will be an entertaining opportunity for any music lover. Again, this concert is on Sunday, November 3 at 3 p.m. at the Morris Area Elementary School.
