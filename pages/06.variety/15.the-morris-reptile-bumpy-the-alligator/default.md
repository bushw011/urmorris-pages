“Do you remember Bumpy?” asks a 2011 article written by Lynn Halbakken for the Stevens County Times. The answer is often no. By now, those of us who are under the age of 50 (and aren’t majoring in biology) do not remember Bumpy, the alligator who lived in Morris in the 1960s. This may sound like the set-up to a bad joke, but Bumpy the alligator was very real, and was a bit of a local celebrity. Throughout his life, Bumpy the alligator would have kids begging their parents to go see him. 

Bumpy resided in Varnum’s Hardware Store, which was once located between Sarlette’s Music and a RadioShack. According to Lynn Halbakken, “Varnum’s also had a second floor, Toyland, which was a great attraction to kids.” Varnum’s was run for 40 years by Ken and Marilyn Varnum who were the second generation within the family to run the store. Ken and Marilyn were responsible for the alligator; they bought him in the late 1950s. Bumpy was purchased to be resold as the store had already been selling pet fish, however, Bumpy remained at Varnum’s for the remaining 15 or so years of his life. Ken Varnum is quoted in Lynn Halbakken’s 2011 article as having said, “Bumpy was the only piece of hardware that we got which we couldn't sell and that died.”

When he was purchased, Bumpy was only 6 inches long, and lived in a wire mesh cage. Moving from the basement of the Varnums’ house to under a stairway in the store to finally being displayed alongside goldfish and tropical pet fish, Bumpy grew into his cage. By the time of his death, Bumpy had grown to be 49 inches long and weighed 14.5 pounds.

James Togeas, a chemistry professor at the University of Minnesota Morris, reflected upon a story of Bumpy’s antics that he had been told in the past, recalling, “In those days, there was a butcher shop adjacent to or near Varnum's. Bumpy was a passive creature, but when the butcher came in, it in got quite agitated, I assume from the scent of the butcher.” The butcher, Art Splitsoser, would bring scraps of raw meat as treats for the alligator, showing that Bumpy was entertaining and intriguing to kids and adults alike. 

When Bumpy died, his body was donated to the biology department at the University of Minnesota Morris, where he is still proudly displayed, thanks to the taxidermy work of a junior biology major in 1974. Bumpy is used occasionally in lessons by Biology professor Heather Waye. Waye, who still teaches at Morris, pointed out that there is still a lot of interest in this alligator and local star even today. Varnum’s was always a fun place to visit and shop and became even more fun after the introduction of Bumpy. 

Returning to the question of whether or not we remember Bumpy, I think it’s fair to say that Bumpy will continue to be remembered for years to come as he proudly sits in the science building on campus. Bumpy is still in a display case in the atrium of the science building along with a print copy of Lynn Halbakken’s original 2011 article.
