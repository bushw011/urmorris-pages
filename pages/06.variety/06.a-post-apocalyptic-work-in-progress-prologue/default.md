It’s not easy being the literal last man on earth, but somebody’s gotta do it.

Mostly, I just listen to women cry a lot about how great Henry was and how Jim “would’ve known what to do in this situation” and how Matt—_God bless, Matt_—used to pretend he hadn’t eaten all the deviled eggs in the fridge, but then spend the entire night making the bed sheets ripple with methane.
    
Well I miss _my_ husband too.

Not to make this about me, but this is my MacBook I stole from Best Buy, and, well, this is gonna be about me.

So it was a normal day, except the dog wouldn’t chill the fuck out. In hindsight, Cool Steve being antsy as all hell should’ve been my first warning that something was up, but I was too focused on being mad at Max. Our, “_you_-get-up-and-find-the-remote” marriage had culminated in him accepting a theater professorship at an out-of-state liberal arts college. This meant that all his waking hours, he’d be around bright-eyed twenty-somethings with everything I don’t have: cute asses, the ability to pull off hipster glasses, and a lust for life they hadn’t yet lost in their sixth and second-to-last men’s room hookup at Perkin’s Restaurant & Bakery.
	
Sooo, I was day drinking and re-watching my box set of _The Golden Girls_. 

And I remember, it was while season-five Blanche was making some new variation-on-a-theme joke about being a whore that the TV slowly darkened, like it was on a dimmer switch.

Now, I’d experienced power outages in the past, as well as cat ownership; the TV suddenly turning off—for whatever reason—was not a particularly new concept for me. What was a new concept for me was the TV _darkening_. That’s not how TVs turn off; the screen is supposed to go black quickly, so the reflection of your doughy, pasty-white body laying on the couch flashes you like a jumpscare in a horror movie.

Instead, this was like gay Dracula had chomped down on the A/V ports, draining the picture of vibrancy, shade-by-shade until there was nothing left.

_Blerghghgh—I’ve come to suck your dick, blerghghgh._

But anyways, the TV having a Technicolor® pulmonary infarction should have been warning number two.

Warning number three, you ask?

That was an actual warning, sent to my phone from the good people of the National Weather Service, saying it was aliens. This was uhhh… _discomforting_. Probably not as discomforting for me as it was for the people who hoped a zombie apocalypse would be the cataclysmic event to wreck our shit, but I’ll never know for sure because that entire demographic had penises and now they’re dead.

But yeah, what I’m trying to say is that the O.G. nut jobs had it right all along; we’re not alone in the universe.

…It just sucks that this was about the only thing the tinfoil helmet crowd _did_ have right.
   
For the record, the aliens didn’t come in peace and their overall, uhhh… assertive demeanor left me with the clear impression that E.T. is a Xanax kinda guy. Oh, and they weren’t green and little any more than they were gray and bug-eyed. Actually, go ahead and forget all concept of xenomorphs, Marvin Martian, and the extended character list from the _Men in Black_ trilogy right now.

They looked human.

They claimed they were, too, despite their red eyes and their too-pale faces. _From the future_, they said.

They explained this to me after they murdered my male neighbors, one right after the other. Through my east window, I saw two of them stab the guy next door. They retracted the blade back into the hilt of the spear-like weapon they were using and loped out the back door, emaciated and hunched and reminding me vaguely of mange-stricken coyotes. They left Angry Stan, the “stop feeding the squirrels!” man, there to bleed out, alone and spread-eagled on his oak coffee table in what was probably a cheap cosmic metaphor for his entire life.

Then—judging from the screams—it was the Jensen boys behind me, followed by Mr. Carlson from across the street. Somewhere, a shotgun sounded.

It wasn’t long afterward that they found me, cowering behind my life-sized cardboard cutout of Diana Ross and clutching my plastic replica of Captain America’s shield. I had lost grip of Cool Steve’s dog collar minutes ago and thick, sticky blood was still dribbling from my hand from where his teeth had torn into the pudgy edge of my palm. He wanted under that damn couch and wasn’t fucking around.

They had come through my front door quietly even though I had octuple checked to make sure it was locked. (It was really the last thing I could do to make it look like no one was home; the lights, A/C, and everything else electronic had shut off when the TV did.)

And you know, even months after it happened, I still don’t know how to describe the way they moved—though I’ll never forget it. Where thick, clumsy dribbles of sweat had slid from my forehead and collected too close to my eyes, evidencing my sheer terror, they just sort of… glided in on those lanky, stretched legs of theirs. They entered cooly, calmly, with the self-assured confidence of nobility and professional athletes. And they wore these gray tunic things made from a material I couldn’t place despite all my _Project Runway_ knowledge, sort of a dull, drab cross between metal and polyester that flowed like cloth but seemed to whisper of a sturdiness even Kevlar doesn’t have.

And the way they talked. Because yes, it wasn’t bad enough they were mass killers that looked like tall, albino, ballerina-vampires from Olympus. Their voices cracked and popped and wheezed like they hadn’t been used in years. They told me this was necessary. They told me this was necessary and that they couldn’t tell me why. They told me they were sorry, too. They were sorry. 

And d’you know, I think I believe them? Something about the way they spoke, every syllable cleaving through their throats like a bell struggling to ring through mud. I don’t know if I’ve ever heard words that sounded so pained, so sincere.
Then they left.

It’s been about three months since then, and the only big change is that now the nightmares are only twice a night. I’m doing surprisingly okay, I just wish I didn’t think about that cryptic interaction I had with them as often as I do.

I still wrack my brains over it—I mean, why me? What made me the exception? Why did I get to live when there were so many men out there who were better than me? They killed devoted fathers, Nobel Peace Prize winners, and children who had never even had the chance to become something less than innocent. What does someone who helicopters their penis during foreplay have to offer the world?

And that day just plays over and over in my mind, the guilt steadily crushing more and more air from my lungs and the facts inescapable until I fall asleep; only then can I escape what happened. I can breathe and suddenly, the aliens are old bachelorettes looking for love, asking each other if their spears make them look fat. I snore and then Betty White is there, playing the honey-barbecue role of Rose Nylund to a round of studio applause.

…And then, on some nights, it just so happens that Max never left for work that day, and damn but if everything doesn’t look fucking perfect as we watch Netflix with Cool Steve’s head resting on my left thigh and Max’s warm arm wrapped gently across the other.

I like having those dreams because even the ones that end up being nightmares are better than what actually happened after they left. I remember the TV had only just turned back on when I felt my phone buzz against my thigh and I inhaled hope like a fucking idiot.

His last words were “I love you,” and he never stood a chance against them.
