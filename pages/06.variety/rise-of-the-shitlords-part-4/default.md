Rise of the Shitlords is a recount of a Dungeons and Dragons campaign that I run with some friends: our players have been transported from their homeland of Sand Point to a different universe contained within the bowels of the Lost Coast Catacombs. In search of the last Guardian of the Gates, our players are engaged in an interplanar cat-and-mouse chase through spacetime to capture the she-demon Nualia before she unleashes the World Eater unto the universe—destroying everything for a thinly-veiled promise of power in the new world that would come. 

Where we last left our players, their help to undo Nualia’s madness was enlisted by the Magistrate of Squall’s End—a jungle elf community located in the hearth of the first level of the Lost Catacombs. While fixing some minor issues in the community, the players had stumbled upon a catastrophe: poisoned mead was causing townspeople to launch into a fit of rage which lead to fights (and in some cases, death). The players reasoned that a good place to start would be a proprietor of mead. This brought them back to the owner of the Wooden Boozer: the incredibly friendly Otaehyrn Magpeter. 

As the players arrived at the Wooden Boozer, the place was hoppin’ (after all, it was after work; it was drinking time). Behind the counter was Magpeter and some extra hands. While his fellows mixed the drinks, Magpeter acted as host—making jokes and laughing with his patrons as they drank. 

Leo the Inspector took a swig of his flask then approached the counter. 

“Otaehyrn, mind if we speak for a bit?” He said, flask in hand. 

“Sure!” responded Magpeter in his North-Elvish [Minnesotan] accent, handing Leo a mug of mead. Leo politely refused the drink. 

“So, Otaehyrn,” 

(Leo succeeded the Diplomacy roll)

“Any problems with the mead lately?” 

Magpeter began to sweat and stammer: “Well, I, uhh, umm—” 

Leo lunged forward and grabbed Magpeter by the shirt, pulling him closely and whispering in his ear. “Listen here, you cretin! There is poisoned mead running amok in your town, and you’re gonna stammer like a coward? Tell me what’s really going on!” 

Otaehyrn’s face was skewed with worry. “Please, you’re making a scene! Let me explain to you what’s going on; it’s in the cellar.” 

He announced to the bar that everything was fine and that he was just showing the local heroes the cellar. Gerald and Maer’n stayed on the main level while the rest of the party moved to the cellar. 

The cellar, lit by torchlight, housed dozens of curing barrels and four large barrels of finished mead. Magpeter led the party to the farthest barrel. 

“About a week ago, I popped the tap into this barrel to get some mead. It was a little darker than usual, but it didn’t phase me… until two patrons beat each other to death. I removed the tap as soon as I knew what was going on, but it was too late—the bar had erupted into a flurry of violence. The Magistrate assured me that these incidents would be wiped from the public’s memory… but somehow it finds its way out of this room. Please help me; I don’t want to see anyone else get hurt.” 

Leo still didn’t trust Magpeter. However, if what Magpeter said was true, then there could be a problem bigger than just a corrupt bartender. Magpeter had to attend to the bar so he left the players to examine the barrel of mead. 

They poured a glass of the tainted mead and detected the same magic used in the mead which drove the Squall’s End soldiers to kill each other. While discussing what to do about the large barrel, Mices decided they weren’t moving fast enough; he took his greatsword and slashed the barrel across its face sending mead everywhere. 

After the initial tsunami of mead, the players focused on what flowed out. A goblin, dressed in black, floated out of the barrel on the current of mead. After closer examination, Leo spotted a broken bottle and a slash mark on the goblins leg with bits of glass inside of it. It seems that someone had sent it into the cellar to poison all of the mead of Squall’s End… but the goblin accidentally infected itself instead. 

That part of the mystery was solved, but how was the mead continuing to enter the town? The players split up to search for an answer. Three Shiv Mac, using the sharp perception of a rogue, noticed something odd. In the wall next to the tainted barrel, a river of mead flowed under the seam. How would this be possible if the cellar was built underground? After pushing and pulling on the wall, the section broke off, sending Three Shiv flying in the process. Looking up from the ground, he found himself staring down a deep, dark tunnel. 

The players surrounded the tunnel. This was where they had to go. What will they find? Will it be the person who was stealing the mead, or something worse? Is it a petty thief in the slums? Or is it a servant of Nualia, left to wreak havoc on Squall’s End in hopes of destroying their community? Find out in the next installment of _Rise of the Shitlords_
