**Mediocre Tech Review will be a review column published every issue
about things that are broken, poorly executed, or simply ill-conceived.**

The NikePlus Fuelband put up for review was used, to say the least. Several parts were missing, which would have allowed me to adjust the length of the wristwrap and make wearing more comfortable, but the missing parts were not ones that could affect the functionality of the electronics within. 

My first couple hours of attempted setup here was incredibly infuriating. I needed to download an app from the Play store to use it, which I expected, but speech bubbles didn’t work for that app on my phone, so, without the ability to create an account there, I had to default to the desktop app. At first, that went better, and the device thankfully charged. There was perhaps an hour or so navigating Nike’s signup process, which was blatantly awful. They make shoes, not websites. Also, they don’t really make wearables. 

I have to say, though, that I like how the charging works, though I’m a little afraid it might eventually scratch the top of my computer. The cord itself actually includes a charging port (male usb) which makes it nice to not have to carry around an adapter, or even a usb cord. Kudos to them on that. 

I’ll also admit that I like the display. It feels a little bit retro, and is bright enough to see most of it even under direct sunlight, and the graphics are easily recognizable, so it was easy to learn the ropes of operating the device’s singular button. 

That’s where the fun ends, though. 

The first time I tried to go out and run with the device, it told me that I’d burned almost a thousand calories from my room to the kitchen in my dorm. I thought the device was misplacing a decimal, but found out that I was wrong later when I’d burned my 99,999th calorie shortly after work, and right before a run. The steps and time seemed to work well, but I was really after an accurate calorie reading. 

The night after that, I spent a very long time in the Nike maze again, and eventually figured out that the inaccurate calorie readings were because the default height and weight (which are optional portions in their interface) were actually set to zero. And these settings were only possible to change within the Nike Plus profile section, which took me 30 minutes and a Youtube video to find. At least I wasn’t really alone in the struggle. Even then, I had to give up my location to make everything work, or to accept the changes at all. I considered giving them a bogus location, like I did with my name and actual birth date (a false name, and an incorrect birthday, though accurate birth year for calculation purposes) but did not. I gave it to them and I regret sending my information out to use a product that doesn’t really work. 

After that, the calorie counter seemed to work, and everything was just peachy until the strap broke right in the middle of work. The interior locking spring simply up and disappeared, and without any of the regular tools that are packaged with it handy, I had to use a very fine screwdriver, and engineered a replacement spring out of Trident Layers gum wrappers. It still took me an hour to get it just right, though. 

Finally, my device was all ready to work. I’d given Nike enough personal information, and done enough tinkering to join the hordes of calorie counters and fitness buffs around the world using similar devices. But that dream was never meant to be. After counting my steps, I realized that a third of the steps I’d made at best had been counted, and to access the steps counted, I had to turn the step counter on with my desktop app, and then cycle through it, past the arbitrary and obligatory NIKEFUEL gauge, which serves no purpose and cannot be disabled. The calorie counter was still incredibly inaccurate, showing that I burned only 1000 calories after eight hours of field work and a six mile run. 

In the end, the Nike Fuelband wound up as a paperweight with an attractive design and stylish exterior. What killed the product was not a lack of a good idea, but Nike’s user interface nightmare and lack of sensors, which are really the whole point of the product. I could only recommend using this if you are a masochist for frustrating and unnecessary software and hardware issues.
