_Rise of the Shitlords is a recount of a Dungeons and Dragons campaign that I run with some friends: our players have been transported from their homeland of Sand Point to a different universe contained within the bowels of the Lost Coast Catacombs. In search of the last Guardian of the Gates, our players are engaged in an interplanar cat-and-mouse chase through spacetime to capture the she-demon Nualia before she unleashes the World Eater unto the universe—destroying everything for a thinly-veiled promise of power in the new world that would come._

Last semester, the story left us with a dismal image. Upon touching the monkey artifact, the players were transported from the royal tent of Squall’s End to the cold abyss of space! The players began to feel bloated, cold, and oxygen was none. Down below them floated a blue marble—but was this Golarion, their home-world? No, it was different (Out of game: here’s a hint, a blue marble. A blue marble). 

But these questions didn’t matter; they were drowning. It was a sea of blackness from which none can surface. Panic still led to each player thrashing uncontrollably, but to no avail. As oxygen deprivation arrived, so, too, did calm. The party of adventurers was left to stare in defeat with nothing but the twinkling stars in the distance for comfort. Each party member’s vision slowly subsided to darkness, their lives flashing before their eyes. 

Suddenly, a large metal ship burst forth from an explosion of light! It passed over head of the adventurers, cast a beam unto them, and, with another flash of light, teleported the players on board! 

They appeared on strange, glowing glass platforms, oxygen, weight, and light reappeared like a slap in the face, and noises like beeping, whirring, and churning flooded their ears. 

“They’re all right! Quickly, grab a stretcher,” a faceless humanoid with what appeared to be blue skin yelled. More blue folks flooded into the party’s vision, some of them carrying stretchers and others carried strange tools. 

Some questions arose in the party’s brains: Who are these people? Where are we? Why is it so fucking noisy? Why am I so aroused? However, before anyone could come to terms with their new environment, the room went black again—this sensory overload was too much for their weakened bodies to handle. 

The party awoke on white beds in a white room dressed in white robes. On one arm there were small tubes connected to bags full of a clear liquid, and on one finger a pinchy-thing ran another tube to a machine which beeped rhythmically. The party began to wonder aloud: Are we dead? 

“Hello travellers! I hope you are all okay!” A large, floating iron sphere with gangly arms and beeping lights entered the room. 

(Out of game: I didn’t plan for what transpired next. I was a little disheartened.)

Mices, the big dumb one, was startled. “What are you?” 

“Well, I’m Care-o-tron—” the robot didn’t finish its sentence before Mices stood up, grabbed one of its arms, and threw it at a wall, breaking it into a hundred pieces. 

Upon witnessing this horrific event, the party got out of its beds and readied itself for anything. They didn’t have any weapons of course (the doctors of the space ship had anticipated their aggression). After a few minutes, a female, human doctor with blond hair entered the room with a clipboard. 

“Hello,” Maer’n, the levelheaded elven bard, said. 

The doctor didn’t respond. She made a few check on her clipboard, then looked outside the room. 

“Alright guys, check them out,” she ordered. Pointing outside the room, she then said, “You four, take the big stinky ones. Everyone else, you can probably handle the other ones.” 

Moments later, a group of human nurses entered the room. Each party member had one nurse attending to them except for Davor and Mices, who both had two. Each nurse wielded a tool that beeped and booped. They asked each party member a series of medical questions, waved their tools in the faces of the party members, and left as quickly as they came, leaving behind the main doctor. 

The doctor looked up form her clipboard, “Greetings, I am Beverly Ambrose, the Chief Medical Officer of Talos 13. I know you all are probably confused, as are we, but we just ask that you relax. If there are any medical questions you have, I’ll be in the other room. However, the captain would like to speak with you. Here he comes now.” 

Doctor Ambrose stepped aside to allow a stately human man to enter the room. He was a 60-year old man, dressed in a red jumpsuit. His wrinkly face showed his experience. 

(Out of game: I sometimes want to strangle my players.) 

“Greetings,” he began. “My name is Alex Yu, and I am the captain of Talos 13, a research vessel that travels through outer space. You may know this as ‘the heavens.’” 

(Out of game: Leo the Inspector stated, “I want to cast unnatural attraction!” I tell him to shut up and wait for me to finish the captain’s speech.) 

“We are from the planet Earth, a world populated entirely by humans. You are the first people we have encountered who are not all human. The year is 2170. We have advanced far beyond the sword and abacus.” 

(Out of game: “I CAST UNNATURAL ATTRACTION ON MICES.”)

While Captain Yu was talking, Leo began to create a mass of energy in his hands behind his back. A smirk appeared on his face. Once the energy ball was large enough, he through it at Mices who was captivated by the captain’s story. This spell caused Mices to… become attracted to the captain. Uncontrollably. 

Mices sprinted towards the captain, gripped him, tore his jumpsuit, and began profusely kissing him. The captain began to yelp muffled cries. Leo then cast unnatural attraction on the captain. 

For one minute, there was n unnatural attraction between the two actors. Leo and the party members laughed their asses off. (Out of game: I did not.)

While the party was enjoying themselves, a battalion of footsteps grew louder from outside the medical room until a group of large, black bodies wielding large, glowing laser rifles burst through the doorway. Their fun stopped pretty quickly. 

The captain scrambled away from Mices and stood in front of the heavily-armed soldiers. “Kill them!” He yelled. 

Leo jumped in front of the party members and yelled, “Wait!” 

(Out of game: I had him roll a diplomacy check. He rolled a 25 or something, so I let this slide.)

The captain’s eyes were wide with fury. Leo just about shit himself. 

“You have three seconds!” the captain yelled. 

“Okay, so, we were just trying to have some fun! I mean, just imagine being thrown through space-time into a new world where you almost die and you learn about all of this technology and you are stressed and everything is bad—” 

“Get on with it!” 

Leo slowed down, “Just give us a chance!” 

The captain stopped for a moment, and then waved the soldier’s guns down. 

“Very well, you get one chance. If you don’t follow our rules, we will kill you.” 

Leo nodded in agreement. 

After a few moments, Mices, scared of the soldiers, began to yell and barreled through the phalanx of highly armed soldiers. “You won’t take me alive!” he yelled back. 

Everyone in the party looked in horror at what just happened. 

“Guards, get him!” the captain yelled after Mices. He then turned to the party. “Collar them.” 

The soldiers surrounded the remaining party members and affixed collars to their necks. 

The captain looked at Leo darkly and said, “These collars are rigged to explode if you break any of our laws. You can’t screw up now.” 

That is where I will leave the story. Tune in next issue to find out what happens to Mices
