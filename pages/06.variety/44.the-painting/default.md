When asked what my most prized possession is, I am always tempted to say “my haunted painting, of course!” There are many issues with this statement, the first of which being that I do not think my haunted painting was actually painted. I’m not an artist in that sense of the word, so I have zero clue what the piece is made of, but I know where it came from and I know that it seems to know something that I don’t.

You see, I grew up in a neighborhood in Milwaukee that had a great deal of art flowing through the community, from tattoos to poetry. There was a man down the street from us, an artist, who passed away several years ago. His sister held what I can only describe as an unconventional estate sale, giving away his art for free to everyone who passed by in hopes of fulfilling his wish of spreading his artwork through the city, the state, the midwest, and beyond.

I was not there for this rehoming of his art, but in a way I wish that I was. My mom happened to be in the area and was invited in by the artist’s sister, who explained the offer. Now, I mean the utmost respect to this man and his family, but this could have made a beautifully cinematic opening to a horror movie: unsuspecting artsy white family acquires haunted painting, one member of the family becomes emotionally attached to it and brings it to his own house, house becomes haunted as well... oh! But I’m getting ahead of myself, yes? Anyway, my mom was a bit confused by this man’s art, but figured that either I or one of my siblings would enjoy it, so she grabbed the most unsettling piece she could find and came straight home. This is how The Painting entered my life; a simple enough story, or at least I think so.

When I came home to visit my family for a day, I did not immediately stock up on snacks or clothes left behind. Instead, I rushed to the attic to find my beloved painting. It had been a couple years since I’d seen it, but I had been begging my parents to get the painting to me here in Morris, somehow. Here it sits above my bed, watching over me every night. If there is some unresting spirit within the art, he is kind and protective.

It would be unfair of me to leave you without a description of The Painting. As far as I have gathered from my mom’s story and from the image itself, it is a portrait of the artist and two of his siblings. Of the children, however, only one has a face, and it is a very indistinct one at that. I am not criticizing this man’s artistic ability at all—I actually am strangely drawn to the emotionless face of his older sibling as well as the scratched-out faces of the other two. The whole of the painting is off-white, inky black, and the hollowest blue I have seen. As an observer of this secret family moment, I feel like there is a key detail or secret in that blue, but it doesn’t worry me at all. Again, this is me settling beautifully into my destined role as the scrawny white guy in a horror movie. It is with all the love that I have in my heart that I declare this painting to be haunted. I wouldn’t have it any other way.
