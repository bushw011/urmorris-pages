> Dear Jon,

> I am a freshman and I have a roommate issue: my roommate has this fixation on sustainability. Now, on the surface level, this isn’t a problem— I mean, like most humans, I enjoy being able to breathe and drink tap water—but my roommate has taken it to a new level. For example, he has thrown away all of his clothes in favor of natural, compostable banana-fabric. Since making the switch, his clothes have begun to compost, leaving a reprehensible smell and a roommate who steals all my clothes! How do I deal with my roommate?

Dear SusPAINable, 
 
I’m not totally sure what the problem is. Have you not exchanged your plebian “Artificial” wardrobe for the superior fabrics of the future? Mother Earth spurns your transgressions and urges you to repent. How can you sustain an ECO-nomic culture if you still cling to the Old World traditions of times passed? The Nana-Fabric is supposed to degrade; permanency is such a mouth-breathing tradition. Do you even know how to build your own solar panels? If not, McLuyver offers some pretty great tutorials on how to make some on the cheap from spent chewing gum and a matchbook.
