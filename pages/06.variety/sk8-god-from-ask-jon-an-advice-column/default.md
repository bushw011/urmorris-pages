I’m not sure how I’m not gonna get more bruised up than a banana at Bend n’ Dent, but when it hits me how to do it, I know I’ll get a sick plaque or honorary credits in some RFC class or some stuff.

Dear sk8 gOD,

I have no idea how to answer your question. I, myself, am not a connoisseur of skateboard godhood. If you plan to kickflip off the roof of the Science Building, please wear a helmet, elbow pads, and knee pads, and pray to Lance Mountain that you don’t die. Additionally, I don’t think that women would flock to you because, in order to attract a significant other, you need more than a few sick tricks to get someone to like you. For example, you should probably work on your personality.
