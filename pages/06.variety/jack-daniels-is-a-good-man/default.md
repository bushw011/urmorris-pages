Let me tell you about my life-long friend, Jack Daniels

He was there for my father when the factory laid him off, 

They sat together all night long and my father was eventually thankful for the tradeoff 

Jack Daniels is a good man. 

I still remember the my first experience with Jack Daniels very well 

I meet Jack Daniel at a barbeque when I was when I was sixteen 

My dad didn’t want me talking to him, I thought that was quiet mean 

He warned me ‘Jack Daniels will make your night Hell,” 

Jack Daniels is a good man. 

I loved Jack Daniel, I snuck him into prom with me. 

I introduced him to my friends that night, they loved him too 

That night we ditched our dates to be with Jack Daniels, and the time just flew 

I don’t remember who drove me home, sometimes Jack Daniels makes things hard to see

Jack Daniels is a good man

When I became an old man I got a great job with a boss who treats me well 

Jack Daniels helped me celebrate after my first work day 

He was there for me on every single difficult day 

I lost that job because I visited Jack during my shift and my boss was mad as Hell 

Jack Daniels is a good man 

Many years have passed since I worked many short-lived jobs 

Sure I have fell on hard times, but I still have my old friend Jack 

Good old jack makes up for everything that I lack 

I might not have a house, family, but I don’t need those snobs 

Jack Daniels is a good man
