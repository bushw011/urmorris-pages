**By Christian Pfeiffer, Editor-in-Chief** _originally published in Issue 6, Volume 30 of the University Register on Friday, December 8, 2017._

**_Sagittarius (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21):_** Winter break is coming up and the temptation is going to be to let yourself idle. Resist the temptation! Take on a fun art project! Begin learning a new skill! Find out how they make Starbursts taste so juicy!

**_Capricorn (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19):_** What if I want to participate but can’t make a Chewbacca noise?

**_Aquarius (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18):_** Wuh-oh! Do I hear wedding bells in the distance, slugger?

**_Pisces (Feb. 19 - Mar. 20):_** Have a written final coming up that you’re stressing over? A good way to avoid any accidental spelling/grammar errors is to plagiarize another person’s work! Whenever you’re in doubt, don’t forget the Four Ps of Academia: Plagiarize, Pickle Rick, Push and Shove, and PBreaking Open a Cold One With the Boys.

**_Aries (Mar. 21 - Apr. 19):_** And now, a hot piece of Astley: 
We’re no strangers to love 
You know the rules and so do I 
A full commitment’s what I’m thinking of 
You wouldn’t get this from any other guy 
I just wanna tell you how I’m feeling 
Gotta make you understand 
Never gonna give you up 
Never gonna let you down 
Never gonna run around and desert you 
Never gonna make you cry 
Never gonna say goodbye 
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you 
We’ve known each other for so long 
Your heart’s been aching but you’re too shy to say it 
Inside we both know what’s been going on 
We know the game and we’re gonna play it 
And if you ask me how I’m feeling 
Don’t tell me you’re too blind to see 
Never gonna give you up 
Never gonna let you down 
Never gonna run around and desert you 
Never gonna make you cry 
Never gonna say goodbye 
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you 
Never gonna give you up 
Never gonna let you down 
Never gonna run around and desert you 
Never gonna make you cry 
Never gonna say goodbye 
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you 
Never gonna give, never gonna give 
(Give you up) 
(Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give 
(Give you up) 
We’ve known each other for so long 
Your heart’s been aching but you’re too shy to say it 
Inside we both know what’s been going on 
We know the game and we’re gonna play it 
I just wanna tell you how I’m feeling 
Gotta make you understand 
Never gonna give you up 
Never gonna let you down 
Never gonna run around and desert you 
Never gonna make you cry 
Never gonna say goodbye 
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you 
Never gonna give you up 
Never gonna let you down 
Never gonna run around and desert you 
Never gonna make you cry 
Never gonna say goodbye 
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you 
Never gonna give you up 
Never gonna let you down 
Never gonna run around and desert you 
Never gonna make you cry

**_Taurus (Apr. 20 - May 20):_** For a fun new twist on Greek yogurt, don’t eat it.

**_Gemini (May 21 - Jun. 20):_** This week’s mandatory listening is Christian Scott Tunde Adjuah’s “West of the West,” two different bicycle horns honking in unison, and the only Christmas song that matters: Paul McCartney’s “Wonderful Christmastime.”

**_Cancer (Jun. 21 - Jul. 22):_** Which is heavier, a pound of feathers, or a £ of feathers? Answer this and nothing will stand in your way.

**_Leo (Jul. 23 - Aug. 22):_** The Void calls, but will you answer it? Will you at least set up your voicemail? 

**_Virgo (Aug. 23 - Sep. 22):_** The stars are telling me a new love will soon enter into your life.

Make it use a condom.

**_Libra (Sep. 23 - Oct. 22):_** Laundry day is fast upon us, will you be ready?

**_Scorpio (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21):_** Keep your circle small and your dodecagon smaller.
