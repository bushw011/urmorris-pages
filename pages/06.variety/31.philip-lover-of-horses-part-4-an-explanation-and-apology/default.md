**By Desmond Homann, Variety Editor** _Originally published in Issue 1, Volume 32 of The University Register on Friday, September 13, 2019_

Perhaps it would be more appropriate to call this “Desmond: Frenemy of Horses” as I have a bit of a secret to reveal. As regular University Register readers may know, I built my entire platform here around my terrible fear of horses. One of my very first pieces in the Variety section was, in fact, Philip: Lover of Horses. This went on to be a three-part serial with empty promises of future chapters. I did intend to write more about Philip, our lovable narrator, Caspian, and any horses involved, but fate had laid out a different course of action for me, a path that involved one of my fears: horseback riding. That’s right, ME, Desmond “I’d fight a horse” Homann, riding on a REAL, LIVE HORSE. None of us could have ever expected this turn of events.

Okay, yes, I did go through many cowboy phases in my life, including this past year, but I had conveniently left horses out of all my dreams of becoming a rad and magical cowboy. I think deep down I felt that it would be more fitting if I drifted into town on a horse-sized spider or scorpion, not an actual horse. This is an important detail to note, as I know my cowfolk nature may add a bit of confusion to this explanation. I assure you all that any cowboy-related things I have said or done in the past had nothing to do with horses or cows in any way. I am terribly allergic to most farm animals.

Alas, I did ride a real horse. I cannot hide this truth any longer. I have betrayed myself, my writing, and all of the thoughts and opinions I used my Variety Editor platform to share. Though I still am allergic to and afraid of horses, I have some new insights to share. Perhaps there were some things I had wrong about horses.
The horse that I rode, pictured below, was a stubborn and hungry fellow named Mouse. I did not tell him that I enjoy his name, as I do not think he deserved to let that compliment go straight to his weird, long head. I also did not share with him that our hair is the same color. I did not want him getting any ideas about us being similar in any way. That being said, I think that we shared a unique understanding each time he would stray from the path to snack on grass and weeds. Think of it this way: if you were strolling through a field of fettuchini alfredo, wouldn’t you stop to slurp up some noodles from time to time? I know that I would. I did not stop him from
snacking; we were in no hurry to get up the mountain. 

It should be noted that, as I am deathly allergic to horses, I had the help of some Benedryl and whatnot. Unfortunately, this meant that I nearly fell asleep several times during horseback riding. As many of my family members would sneakily say, “I was only resting my eyes!” Now, I’m not enough of a fool to fall asleep in the presence of my worst enemy. When my eyelids did grow a little heavier than intended, however, Mouse did not lead me astray or crush my small, fragile bones with his hooves. It really does make you think, doesn’t it?

Do I trust horses? No. Do I like horses? No. Do I feel the need to go horseback riding again? Certainly not. This being said, it is only fair to admit that I know which horse I would want on my side in a fight. In a world without giant spiders for me to swoop in on when I save the day, I suppose this horse would not be unnacceptable. I still stand firmly by my beliefs, but I thank Mouse for not killing me when he had the chance. Maybe there are _some_ good horses out there, but you didn’t hear that from me. 

Yeehaw,

Desmond
