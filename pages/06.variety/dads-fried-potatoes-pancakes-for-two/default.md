 This time I’d like to share one of my family’s favorite breakfasts. We love pancakes and make them every Saturday morning along with biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, and bacon. We are breakfast people! “Breakfast is the most important meal of the day,” or at least we like to believe it is. I prefer dessert myself. Pancakes, however, are good any time of the day with peanut butter, jam, or with whipped cream and berries. Even if you don’t want to go through the trouble of making this recipe, mixing some water with a box mix can still be a lot of fun. 

Pancakes for Two is my favorite recipe for breakfast because it’s the perfect amount of pancakes to eat at breakfast time, and it doubles really well when cooking breakfast for family or all your housemates. 

Pancakes for Two: Serves ~ 2 

Ingredients: 

1 cup AP flour 

1/4 cup White Sugar 

1 Tablespoon Baking Powder 

¼ Teaspoon Salt 

1 cup Milk 

1 egg 


1 tablespoon oil 

Add all the dry ingredients to a bowl and mix. 

Form a well (a bowl) and add the milk, egg, and oil to the mixture, and mix well. 

Turn the stove on to medium – high heat and add a small amount of oil to a pan. 

After the pan is hot, pour 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup of the pancake mixture into the pan, depending on how big you want your pancakes. 

When the bubbles that form on the top of the pancake begin to pop the pancakes are ready to flip. Now is when you can be impressive and try to flip the pancakes only using the pan, or just use a regular spatula if you’re not up for it. 

When the pancakes are ready drizzle your favorite toppings over them and dig in!
