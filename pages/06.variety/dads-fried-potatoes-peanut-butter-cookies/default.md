 Hi everyone! I’m here to bring you some home cooking recipes that I’ve tried on my own, or are a proven favorite of my parent’s. Cooking isn’t always easy, but I find it relaxing and I hope you do too. 

I wanna start this off with something sweet: peanut butter cookies! 

My roommates recommend topping them with toffee bits, mixing them with chocolate chunks, or both. However you choose to prepare these cookies, they’re easy to make and go well with a scoop or 12 of ice cream. 

Also! It’s important to remember that cooking, especially with friends, is supposed to be fun. So don’t stress out on the small stuff when following a recipe. I firmly believe that if you cook with good intentions and with good friends the results will taste better in the long run. 

PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES: ~24 Servings 

1 ¼ cup of All-Purpose Flour 

¾ teaspoon of Baking Soda 

¼ teaspoon of Salt 

½ cup or 1 stick of Unsalted Butter, Room Temperature 

½ cup of Peanut Butter 

½ cup of packed Brown Sugar 

½ cup of Granulated Sugar 

1 Egg* 

½ teaspoon of Vanilla Extract 

½ cup of Granulated Sugar (for the top of the cookies) 

First, preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Second, cream the butter, peanut butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together in a bowl. Then add 1 egg and the vanilla extract and mix well until combined. 

In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt, and whisk them together, or just stir them with your fingers, but please wash your hands. 

Now you’re going to want to add the dry ingredients in thirds, mixing them into the butter and sugar mixture until just combined. Here’s where you can add some bomb additions like chocolate chunks, unless you ate them all before getting them into the cookies. The dough will be THICC so just fold the chunks in gently like you’re wrapping a small kitten in a towel. 

Next, you will want to line a cookie sheet with parchment paper, a silicone mat, or maybe your midterm from that class you hate (please don’t do this), lining your pan makes for an easier clean up, ensures that your cookies will not stick, and helps to bake them more evenly. 

Roll the dough into 1-inch balls and space them about 3 inches apart on your cookie sheet. Alt: Make the cookies as big as you want, just make sure you check to make sure they are done before eating them. 

Now take that extra bowl of sugar and dip a fork in it. Use the fork to press the dough balls down to get the classic peanut butter cookie crust. My roommate argues only one horizontal and one vertical press is enough. I say 2 each way. Here you can add toppings to your cookies, like those toffee crumbles my roommates enjoy so much. 

Finally bake them at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 -12 minutes. I recommend that halfway through you turn the cookie sheet around in the oven to ensure an even bake. 10 minutes will usually give you a nice chewy cookie, while 12 minutes will give you something crisp and dunkable in milk. 

*You can also replace the egg with a mashed banana if you really enjoy peanut butter banana sandwiches or you want an even chewier cookie. 

If you’ve tried this and want to show me how they turned out, or if you have any recipes you want me to try for future editions, email me your pictures and recipes at meste020.
