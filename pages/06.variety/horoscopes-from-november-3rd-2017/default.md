**By Christian Pfeiffer, Editor-in-Chief** _originally published in Issue 4, Volume 30 of the University Register on Friday, November 3, 2017_

**_Scorpio (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21):_** Current Secretary of Education, Betsy Devos, is willing to use federal dollars to fund schools that discriminate against students based upon race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender. 

**_Sagittarius (Nov 22. - Dec. 21):_** Planned Parenthood doesn’t use federal funding to provide abortions. This is a law already in place. Further, abortions only make up about 3% of all services performed by Planned Parenthood yearly. The remaining 97% of services they provide involve helping people receive basic healthcare. 

**_Capricorn (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19):_** The repeal of the Affordable Care Act is estimated to kill 43,000 Americans yearly. 

**_Aquarius (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18):_** The vast, VAST majority of Medicaid benefits are paid out to the elderly, disabled, children, and pregnant women, and the president’s Counselor, Kellyanne Conway’s solution to their loss of benefits under new laws is that they can always get jobs. 

**_Pisces (Feb. 19 - Mar. 20):_** African Americans are six times more likely to be charged for drug offenses as whites, despite the fact these groups use drugs at roughly the same rates. 

**_Aries (Mar. 21 - Apr. 19):_** Gay teens are eight times more likely than straight, cisgender teens to commit suicide, and make up more than half of the teen homeless rate. And may God have mercy upon the right-wing vultures on campus who make jokes about this stuff. 

**_Taurus (Apr. 20 - May 20):_** The president recently made a joke about how Vice President Pence would like to hang gay people. It still gives me a good chuckle whenever I think about it, I swear. 

**_Gemini (May 21 - Jun. 20):_** Political correctness isn’t about limiting your freedom of speech, it’s about being respectful to your fellow human beings. The recent bill drafted by Indiana Representative Jim Lucas, which would require journalists to be fingerprinted and licensed by state police, is about limiting your freedom of speech. Please get this right. 

**_Cancer (Jun. 21 - Jul. 22):_** Mass shootings are currently happening at such a frequency in the U.S. that it may always be “too soon” to talk about gun control from here on out. 

**_Leo (Jul. 23 - Aug. 22):_** Flint, Michigan has been without clean water since April 25, 2014. 

**_Virgo (Aug. 23 - Sep. 22):_** The torch company Tiki had to distance themselves from white supremacists in a public statement, following their use in a white nationalist rally that resulted in the deaths of three people in Charlottesville, Virginia. This was a thing that happened this year. 

**_Libra (Sep. 23 - Oct. 22):_** The University of Minnesota’s Board of Regents Policy outlines twenty-one forms of student misconduct that the University may take disciplinary action against. Casual reminder that if you have specific, documented instances of students harming your ability to learn; students threatening, stalking, harassing, intimidating, or assaulting you; students bullying you with repeated, aggressive behavior, such as terrorization, making obscene gestures, or invading your personal space; or of students willfully disrupting University events, YOU CAN REPORT THEM. Filing reports and documenting instances of student misconduct helps to ensure we hold the University accountable when our learning environment is willfully sabotaged by megaphone-wielding megalomaniacs and their little brothers.
