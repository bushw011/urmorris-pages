> _Rise of the Shitlords is a recount of a Dungeons and Dragons campaign that I run with some friends: our players have been transported from their homeland of Sand Point to a different universe contained within the bowels of the Lost Coast Catacombs. In search of the last Guardian of the Gates, our players are engaged in an interplanar cat-and-mouse chase through spacetime to capture the she-demon Nualia before she unleashes the World Eater unto the universe—destroying everything for a thinly-veiled promise of power in the new world that would come._

In our previous installment, everything went terribly wrong (Out of game: because everyone hates me and wanted to wreck me). After being spit into space by an intergalactic spacetime mega-portal and getting teleported aboard a large space station, our party members found themselves in the medical bay of Talos 13—a highly-advanced scientific research station populated by a large assortment of humans.

Instead of allowing the care and hospitality of the scientists aboard the station, our party members decided to play practical jokes (which were both embarrassing and harmful) on the crew members. After being assaulted by Mices, the Captain of the ship, Alex Yu, ordered his guards upon the party, affixing their necks with explosive dog collars. However, the guards couldn’t get to everyone.

Mices barreled past the guards with tremendous strength, pushing some of them to the ground, while screeching at the top of his lungs “Stranger danger, stay away!” He rounded a corner, his voice trailing away as he ran down the hall.

“Get him!” yelled a red-faced Captain Yu, pointing after Mices.

After gathering themselves, a small group of guards sprinted after Mices with their laser blasters drawn. To their horror, by the time they had rounded the same corner Mices had taken, he had vanished, and at the end of that hallway was an elevator. Mices could be anywhere in the Station.

In fact, Mices had simply taken the elevator down one floor to the main level of the ship. Upon rounding the corner after escaping the medical bay, Mices saw two beams: one green with an arrow pointing upwards, and a red one with an arrow pointing downwards. Because he likes the color of blood, he ran towards the red one. The beam paralyzed him and slowly lowered him to the next floor. He was, of course, terrified because he thought he had run into a magical trap! But, he was assuaged when, upon touching the next floor, he could run again.

The room he entered had three possible ways for him to run: a large hallway stretched before him and two tributaries branched off in opposite directions from the main hallway. Since the large and open hallway meant more people, he ducked to the hallway on his right. Confident that he had chosen correctly, he scrambled rightward... only to collide with a puny scientist.
The scientist fell on his back as if running into a door swinging open. Mices quickly apologized and tried to lift up the scientist. To the dismay of the scientist, Mices was not only dressed in bloody armor, but he was also quite a bit larger than the scientist himself. The scientist could feel his lungs constrict and his breathing quicken. “Oh god, not again,” he thought, his asthma attack worsening by the second. Quickly, he reached into his lab coat to grab the device that would help him.

After picking up the scientist, Mices looked at the scientist, “Hey, uh, where can I hide for a bit? I’ve got some people after me and I don’t wanna go with them.” Then, Mices noticed the breathing of the scientist.

“Oh, sorry man.”

Then Mices saw the inhaler.

“Hey man!” Mices swiped the inhaler from the hands of the scientist before the scientist could inoculate himself. “Is this a weapon? Are you trying to kill me?”
The scientist responded with a series of wheezing noises, a hand on his neck, and a hand pointing at the inhaler. Mices didn’t get it. However, Mices was intrigued: on the hand that was pointing there was as large gauntlet with beeping noises coming from it.

“Hey look man! Just tell me where to go, get me a uniform, give me your arm thingy, and then you can have your gun back, ok?!”

The scientist nodded in agreement and wheezed affirmatively.

Mices handed the inhaler back to the scientist, which he quickly imbibed. The sensation of oxygen flowing back to his lungs was incredibly refreshing. Two things were clear to the scientist at this moment: Mices wasn’t going to be getting a uniform and, by giving him his PipBoy 2000 armband, he could trick Mices.
“Thank you for giving me back my inhaler. Now, as promised, here is your armband.” The scientist handed over the armband to Mices. Mices looked at it with joy. “Now, what you do,” he said, pointing at the big button that said “EMERGENCY” on it, “is you press this button. It makes this armband get really colorful.”

Mices couldn’t resist.

He strapped it on his wrist.

Then, he touched the button.

There were definitely lights. To his delight, they were also red. However, there was also a horn that blared loudly, alerting nearby security. The scientist quickly fled and Mices was in a panic.

Swinging his head side-to-side, Mices knew he had to get out of there. A moment later, a room caught his eye. To his immediate left, a door swooshed open and people carrying boxes of glowing materials of various colors walked about, pouring the contents of the boxes into one side of a large machine. A person standing at the controls of the machine pushed a few buttons, causing loud whirs and clicks followed quickly by a bell sound and a finished product on the other side of the machine.


However, in a Mician fashion, it was not the machine itself that made Mices excited, but the glowing material consumed by the machines.

Quickly forgetting his troubles and mesmerized by the colors, Mices—still brandishing a tripped armband—walked through the door and watched the people move around. The doors shut behind him and through the window could be seen a battalion of guards rushing past. At this moment, it seemed the factory’s machinery, for whatever reason, masked the signal of the armband 
(Out of game: I felt bad for Mices, so I improvised a deus ex machina to help him out.)

The factory foreman approached him cautiously. “Hello, who are you?” She asked Mices.

Mices looked at her, “I’m Mices.”

“You looking for work?”

“I guess.” Mices motioned to his armband. “Can you get this off me and get me a uniform or something?”

The foreman thought for a second. “Prove to me that you can lift.”

In the center of the room were a bunch of shelves containing boxes of glowing material. Most scientists could only lift a box.

Mices grabbed 3 boxes with one hand and with the other dumped the contents of each box into the machine at the front of the room. The foreman punched some buttons on the machine, and after some clicking and whirring came a uniform. The foreman grabbed the new piece of clothing then approached Mices. With a few touches on the armband, the alarm stopped, and the band fell off Mices’ arm. She then handed Mices the new uniform and extended her hand.

“Welcome aboard, Mices.”

Mices shook her hand.

By this, I, of course, mean that Mices looked at her hand, touched it with a single finger, asked her “What are you doing,” then she had to explain what a handshake was. He acted like he understood what she said, but he was too busy thinking about the colors of the manufacturing resources. He took her hand but, rather than shaking it up and down, he whipped her hand around in a circle motion and grunted in affirmation. The foreman, of course, assumed that this was how he greeted people in his homeworld. However, they also use handshakes in Valeria, but Mices had never learned what they were—he deals in cold steel, not warm fuzzies.

Mices, after causing uproar last session, has finally found safety. However, what of the rest of the party? Are they safe? Did they also find employment? Or are they dead? Tune in next issue to find out.
