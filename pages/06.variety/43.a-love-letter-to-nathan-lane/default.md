This is a love letter to Broadway and film star Nathan Lane, so if you are not Nathan Lane, please respectfully avert your eyes now and go no further. Thank you for understanding.

Nathan, now that it’s just us, let me first say hello. I’m assuming you’re familiar with some of my previous writing here in the University Register, specifically the article I wrote on your DELIGHTFUL work in the 1997 film Mouse Hunt. Though I may have poked some fun at the movie and the villainous mouse, I assure you that I would never make fun of your work.

Watching Mouse Hunt was part of a larger marathon of your works. I’m a huge fan and am trying to watch more things that you have been in. Of course, I always have to rewatch The Birdcage and The Producers, but you would be proud to know that I have added a new film to my Nathan Lane list: Ironweed. I am embarrassed to say that I did not originally know that you were in this movie (I was watching it as part of my Tom Waits movie marathon… I’ve got to show support for my other celebrity crushes too! Two of my all-time favorites in one movie. With Meryl Streep, too? I felt like a pretty lucky guy when I found that movie.) It’s unfortunate that you didn’t get much screen time in this film, but you made a pretty cute ghost regardless.

I’ve always been pro-ghost in general; I’m confident that they exist but I’m sure most of them are friendly and well-intentioned. Anyway, I’m getting distracted. I am here to confess my love for you and to invite you to a socially-distanced lunch or something similar. My ideal social distancing lunch with you would be a picnic with delicious soup and sandwiches. You can make your sandwich however you’d like, or I can surprise you, if you’d prefer. Sandwiches are my favorite food, so I’ve certainly got plenty of ideas for toppings. I don’t know what your soup of choice is, though, so I will have to take a guess. I feel like you would likely be alright with a homemade leek and potato soup, right?

Before you or anyone else comes after me angrily, let me say that your husband seems very handsome and polite. Hey, I’m no homewrecker! I’m not here to get between the two of you, I simply want to sit down with you for a chat and some sandwiches! Who knows, maybe we can even bring Tom Waits with us, but I’m going to get my hopes up too high. After all, I’m certain you’re busy with one thing or another right now. A quick Google search tells me that you’re actually auctioning off a virtual chat with the proceeds going to a charity. I could make my dream a reality, but the current bid is 1,300 dollars and I’m about a thousand short… oh, to be financially stable enough to afford a conversation with you! I will instead have to shout my love for you here and hope that, somehow, somewhere, you wake up in the middle of the night with this message telepathically burned into the back of your mind.

So my dear, sweet, Nathan Lane, please know that I appreciate you, and please join me sometime for soup and sandwiches. I promise that I’m not scary, I just think you’re really neat. I have also heard in an interview that you are a cuddly person (or maybe it’s just that you give off that vibe with your personality— I can’t remember.) I think we have the perfect height difference, in that case. I hope that you will take all of this into consideration and will have a chat with me even though I am too poor to bid on you for charity.

Your friend and fan,

Desmond :)
