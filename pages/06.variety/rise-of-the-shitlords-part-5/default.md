**By Jon Antonsen, Variety Editor** _originally published in Issue 5, Volume 30 of the University Register on Friday, November 17, 2017._

Rise of the Shitlords is a recount of a Dungeons and Dragons campaign that I run with some friends: our players have been transported from their homeland of Sand Point to a different universe contained within the bowels of the Lost Coast Catacombs. In search of the last Guardian of the Gates, our players are engaged in an interplanar cat-and-mouse chase through spacetime to capture the she-demon Nualia before she unleashes the World Eater unto the universe—destroying everything for a thinly-veiled promise of power in the new world that would come. 

When we last left our players, they had just uncovered a secret tunnel in the mead cellar of the Wooden Boozer. Earlier, the players witnessed two soldiers of the Squall’s End army beat each other to death. When they examined their corpses, the party found that the soldiers were under the influence of a suggestion spell. 

The source? 

Two bottles of mead. 

The players headed to the only proprietor of mead they knew in the town: Otaehyrn Magpeter, the owner of the Wooden Boozer. 

After a very visible interrogation, Magpeter told the party what was up: during Nualia’s stay in the community, one of the mead barrels was poisoned. Magpeter, unbeknownst to him, put a tap in the affected barrel and served it to some guests during the day. They ended up killing each other. The Magistrate of Squall’s End tried to cover it up to keep the illusion of peace in his town. Since that incident, Magpeter swore that he hasn’t served it since. The players destroyed the barrel to make sure. 

However, after finding the tunnel in his shop, the players are beginning to think that Magpeter is telling the truth. 

The players stared down the long, dark tunnel, shuffling nervously while trying to decide who should go first… well, except for Mices. 

Mices ripped his greatsword out from the busted mead barrel, cast a torchlight spell on himself, and galloped into the swallowing abyss, screaming and yelling and making a ruckus. 

Needless to say, the rest of the party firmly planted their hands into their faces. 

After running for a while, Mices came to a short ladder which ended in a trapdoor. The tunnel extended further; however, he stopped to investigate its destination. Rather than waiting for the rest of the party, the large toddler thought to himself, “Let’s go!” and proceeded to burst through the trap door into a tent. [Out of game note: I severely underestimated what one can achieve when you forgo Intelligence in lieu of strength. This next battle proceeds rather quickly.] 

The party members, far behind Mices, ran into the tunnel after him because they understood that a mess would be waiting for them when they finally did catch up to Mices. As they reared the corner of the ladder’s location, they heard a huge crash of wood splintering and some yelling. 

The party let out a collective sigh of disappointment. 

As Mices burst through the trapdoor, he drew his sword. He was surrounded by [Out of game: what I thought were] heavily armed guards. In the center of them sat a gangly, green-skinned elf wearing a black hood and robe on a throne of bones. 

“I am Aymer the Grim! Why do you stand before me?” The green elf snarled. 

Mices replied with a mighty roar. [Out of game: I can’t remember what he said, I didn’t write it down. In my notes for this episode I literally just wrote “snappy comeback” and I don’t know what that means.] 

Taken aback by his defiance, Aymer screeched at his guards: “Kill him!” 

(Out of Game: Mices rolled a ’20,’ a critical, on his Initiative roll, meaning he got to go first.) 

Without hesitation, Mices sprung forward to attack Aymer. The guards lunged towards Mices to stop him, but they weren’t quick enough. With a mighty swing, he sliced the head off Aymer’s body, sending it to the ground before the guards’ feet. 

The rest of the party arrived at the ladder just in time to hear Aymer get beheaded. Peering up through the now-broken trapdoor, Leo witnessed Mices fighting with four “heavily armed” guards. Now, rather than join the fight, Leo thought it best to let Mices do his thing. So, what did he do? He cast Bull’s Strength on Mices. This increased Mices’ Strength and substantially increased his damage output. 

Because of this, Mices started to one-shot all the guards (meaning he killed them in one hit). 

After only a minute or so, the “heavily armed guards” were brought to their end. 

Once the dust settled, the rest of the party joined Mices in the tent. This tent was located in the Slums of Squall’s End and within it were boxes of bottles of mead—which was tainted. Upon examining Aymer’s body, they found a note. 

“Take the mead and bring it to me. For payment, you may take one crate of fifteen to sell in the Slums.” The note was signed “W. Iliwreak.” The only W. Iliwreak the party knew was Wa’avera—the leader of the Iliwreak clan, and the father of Mices’ “wife” (who, if you remember, was the woman with whom Mices had an infatuation). 

Rather than confront him directly, the party wanted to figure out the whole story. They opted to continue down the tunnel. What will be waiting our players in the dark abyss? More smugglers? A monster? Or something else? 

Join me next week as we solve the mystery of the tainted mead and conclude the first level of the Lost Coast Catacombs.
