Summer was always your favorite season even though summer brought rain, the kind of rain that punched at the back of your neck, the wind pushing it and pelting heavy droplets sideways. You’d always vowed to get out of this little town with its quarrelsome wind. The past 46 or so years had passed you by, though, and not once did you buy a single bus ticket. You stayed, working yourself to death and to madness selling used office furniture to businesses in neighboring towns, larger towns than yours but still small enough. These were businesses that couldn’t quite afford the real deal, businesses full of people who couldn’t afford sleek new kitchen sets. You didn’t feel bad for them; at least they had jobs. You were a firm believer in the power of work, your bills were always paid on time, and you could afford to get your kitchen redone, sleek and modern just how your wife wanted it. 

Your wife didn’t work, but was always up to one thing or another. She always had something to say, but never about anything that mattered. She got together with the neighbors sometimes—was it Monday nights? A book club or wine with friends? Yeah, yeah, she had told you a couple times, but you just didn’t have the time for that bullshit.

Sorry, you didn’t fight with her often, only when the meatloaf had the texture of the very cork boards you sold or when she rambled on about Does This Hat Clash With My Jacket? Folks around town found the two of you to be quite charming and made sure to check up from time to time. Things were happy enough, that’s what you said, except when you were home, of course, when you said that you were This Close To Burning Down The Entire Goddamn House If You Don’t Get That Rat Of A Dog To Stop Barking. But, yes, you didn’t tell them that part and things were happy enough. 

Things weren’t happy enough to stay forever, though. After 46 years of spitting small town hospitality through your teeth, you decided it was time to head straight to the top and live out a couple Wild Years far away from home. Leaving early in the morning, you drove to the next town over, the closest one big enough to have a bus station. Leaving town wasn’t as emotional an ordeal as one might think, even with you having grown up here. This wasn’t surprising, as you were the kind of
man who didn’t cry at the end of movies and didn’t waste time sitting around and waiting on sunsets. This town was nothing more to you than a dot on the map in your glovebox. Sure, you had made plenty of memories at that diner on the left, had won baseball games at the high school around this next corner, and dodged the dusty prairie winds down these streets. None of that mattered, you assured yourself, clenching your jaw and stepping out of that boring past.

Arriving right on time—which was an odd way to feel for someone who hadn’t planned this trip out—you bought a ticket for the cheapest Greyhound you could. The rain was still melting down when you left, decorating the windows of the bus. You didn’t think to bring an umbrella, but who knew where you could end up after a bus or two, or more for that matter. The ideal destination was wherever the air was fresh and clean, some place where people lived for tomorrow, but not much further.

One bus did lead to another, both unremarkable but disagreeable. The whole experience smelled of cheap cigarettes, not yours—you had quit years ago because your wife always complained about the smell and any attempts to disguise it failed. This was your first trip by bus, and you reached the conclusion that people who took the bus were all either far too loud or suspiciously quiet. As the only decent and respectable man present, you were excluded from this criticism, of course. You sat, stiff and starchy, making sure your clean-pressed button-up shirt didn’t touch the window on your left or the passenger on your right, some kid who decorated his face with too much metal. You didn’t have a son, but if you did, you’d skin him alive before you’d let him out of the house with earrings and an eyebrow piercing. No self-respecting young man would present himself in such a queer manner. You thought of your non-existent son, of your own childhood, of your dad—an honorable man who worked his way up from nothing. You rode like this, in silence, until evening marked your arrival.

Summer brought more than just rain to town when you pulled your one lonely suitcase from beneath the bus. As you looked around, you realized that summer had brought you along. The town you found yourself in was larger than where you had started, but left plenty to be desired. So this was it, at least for now. Here you were,
stranded in some muddy town a little ways outside St. Louis, at least that’s how the folks on the bus described it. You had caught bits and pieces of their conversations, scraps of information about a great deal of things you didn’t care about, excitement about baseball games, Fourth of July celebrations, or family reunions that you’d gladly stay far away from. If you could get to the city itself, however, you figured you could find exactly what you were looking for, even if this adventure simply led you to a bar. The rain was still coming down somehow, so it was time to move. A quick cab trip took you to a hotel nearby, but the driver had asked too many questions and had tried too hard to be friendly, so you stiffed him on the tip. Why would you tip someone you’d never see again anyway?

Though you could still hear the rain beating out lonely patterns on the roof and the windows, the hotel was quiet except for the occasional pop of bubblegum. The girl at the counter was chewing absentmindedly, eyes drowsily locked onto a colorful tabloid magazine. You knew these kinds of people, women tattooed with the names of former lovers and men who couldn’t hold a lover down in the first place, much less a job or a hobby. Not to brag, but you considered yourself talented in the art of reading others. It’s one of those things that you’re just gifted with or you aren’t, and you were one of the lucky geniuses, or so you thought.

As you lugged your bag up to the counter, you got a good look at this woman. It wasn’t in a creepy way, you told yourself. You were a married man, after all. A married man who hadn’t left a note behind. You decided it was probably better to not think about your wife, or ex-wife, or whatever she was now or would be when she realized you weren’t just staying late at work. Right now you only had yourself to worry about, and had nothing in mind besides a bit of small talk regarding this girl behind the desk. Curious, you checked her name tag.

“Ruby. Pretty name.”

“Good evening. How can I help you tonight?” The girl behind the counter sat up in her chair, setting the magazine down in her lap but not closing it. Polite enough, but there was no enthusiasm in her voice, which you felt was essential for someone in her line of work. This girl was probably in her mid-twenties and looked plain in every way, with delightfully average almond eyes and a boring polo shirt. She had an impressive layout of snacks on the desk beside her, including a massive mug of coffee.

“You must be working overnight. Tough luck, kid,” you joked, drawing only a stiff smile to her face. She remained unmoving except for a small shrug.

“Wouldn’t hurt you to smile more, would it? I bet you’d look cute.” She didn’t seem to like this comment.

“Are you here for a room or not? Because I don’t talk to strangers, not like that.”

“It was only a joke, honey,” you sighed, leaning forward against the counter and closing some space between yourself and Ruby, “And before you ask again, yes. I need a room for the night. I also need help finding my way to the city tomorrow, and I’d really rather not take another bus. They let pretty much anyone on there! I bet half those men were either ex-cons or homosexuals... one or the other. Can’t tell and don’t care to tell, you know what I mean? Anyway, think you could point me towards someone decent who could help?”

Ruby took a deep breath, though you couldn’t tell why she was in such a foul mood. Like you had said, she could certainly smile more. A girl like her could probably find a better job and a nice man if she were a little friendlier. She adjusted herself in the chair and began to scratch things down, stopping only when she had to ask for your name and your other information.

“It’s pouring out! Nice and dry in here. Warm, too. You must love having such an easy job, other than having to work overnight, that is.”

“Nice? Easy? That’s one choice of words,” she muttered under her breath, not looking up at you. You didn’t quite pick up her tone, so you continued to make small talk.

“What were you reading? Something fun, I bet.”

“Wow!” Ruby exclaimed bitingly, a frustrated smile spreading across her face, “that ring sure looks expensive. I bet your wife has an expensive ring too. She must be real lucky to have such a loyal and respectful husband.” 

This time you did not have a hard time understanding her tone, though you were surprised by her unprofessional nature. You hadn’t done anything, so why were you receiving poor customer service? You blamed her age. Younger girls like her just needed to learn a thing or two about the real world.

You kept trying to make small talk, but she just wasn’t giving back the same energy that you were putting into the conversation. You turned your attention to the hotel lobby itself, with its sickeningly orange carpet and mustard-yellow wallpaper. The fireplace was fake, as were the bowls of fruit and flowers teetering on half the visible surfaces.

Ruby didn’t have anything else to say to you when she gave you the key to your room, but you said a pleasant goodnight to her anyway. That night you got the best sleep you had gotten in the past 20 years, not because of the stiff bed or the hum of the hallway lights, but because it was your first night alone. You never could stand that dog back home, could you? You laughed to yourself a bit, finding this observation to be pretty amusing. That damn dog and his poor eyesight and his neverending yapping. You got the best sleep of your adult life, and the next morning you headed out without eating breakfast, brushing your teeth, or even stopping to say goodbye to Ruby, who was still hardly working up front.

Ruby had told you the night before about a group of performers who were stopping in town before heading out, and St. Louis would be their next stop. If you got there in time, the folks in charge would let you tag along, just as she had mentioned. They weren’t supposed to be too far away. The address sitting heavily in your pocket indicated that the walk was short, especially now that the rain had let up a bit. You wondered what kind of performers these people could be. Were they actors? Musicians? Wouldn’t it be great to kick off your Wild Years by meeting a famous person? That would certainly be the quickest way to get up to the top. You turned the final corner, and at the end of the street you saw it: the entrance to the county fairgrounds.

“This can’t be right. Why would anyone in their right mind be there?” You didn’t want to go any further, but decided to check just to be safe. 

The overly friendly mud had pretty well coated your shoes at this point, and you sighed in disgust, not sure how you’d ever get them clean.

“Suede is hard to clean.” A voice like a heavy chain over gravel greeted you, blunt and raspy.

You looked up to see a menacing wisp of a man leaning against the fence just outside the entrance. You hadn’t noticed him while walking up, but he seemed the kind of person to cling to shadows like a bad tattoo clings to a gun street girl.

“I’m aware. They’re my shoes, after all.”

“I simply said so because, well,” he laughed, a low noise that sounded like that out of a fairy tale monster, “I can’t say I’ve seen anyone dumb ‘nough to wear suede shoes to the fair.”

“Now that’s the thing. I’m supposed to talk to the man in charge of some group or another and I’m afraid I must be in the wrong place.”

“You’re looking at him, Frankie baby,” he roared, gesturing dramatically to himself. His rings shone bright despite how overworked his hands looked, and you could have sworn you saw at least two or three watches on each wrist, though it was hard to tell under the long coat he wore. This man was eccentric, to say the least. Judging by the state of his hair and clothes it would be fair to joke that he had been dead for the past 100 years and had just recently crawled out of the ground, yet also clearly around your age and full of life, an arsonist’s gleam in his smiling eyes. You were familiar with that look, a look that a younger version of yourself thought that he wanted to have, but that was before you settled down. Though he stood tall and relaxed, you felt irrationally that if you looked away he would likely twist and contort his body in a number of impossible ways. Something about this man was uncomfortable, and the more you prodded at him with your eyes, the wider he grinned.

“How’d you know my name? And it’s Frank. Nobody calls me Frankie.”

“A friend of mine dropped me a line, Frankie, said you gave her a bit of a hard time, but there are no hard feelings.” The man, whose name you still didn’t know, was at your side in one fluid movement, an arm around your shoulder and your bag already in his other hand. 

“Walk with me, Frankie.”

You let him lead you into the fairgrounds, much more bustling than you had expected. On your left, a man was being strapped into a massive bear costume. Your shoulders ached just looking at it, especially the mask. On your right, if you looked past your cryptic host, you could see a group of women crowded around a cage, but you didn’t want to know what was inside it. None of these people looked your way, and each person was deeply focused on whatever strange task he was working on. Though clearly hard at work, the people of the troupe were exuding energy, laughter and whispers bubbling over. There was no audience here, no true celebration, but something other than clouds was in the air.

“You’ve gotten here just in time. You see, we’re getting ready for the upcoming festival season and we’re really looking to make this year wild. How are we supposed to compete with the fair in the city if we don’t start early?”

When he said wild you stopped for a moment, feeling as if a familiar friend had just jumped in front of you. You did your best to conceal this growing smirk, as you didn’t want to further encourage the host.

“Now don’t be scared. It’s nothin’ too dangerous or silly, Frankie. But we’ve got just the job for you and I know you’ll make a great addition to the gang.”

“Addition?” Now this was the part that snapped you from your curiosity, “I’m not joining you, I’m just trying to catch a ride to the city.” You looked again at his dirty clothes, his dirty fairgrounds, and his twisted, cat-like smile. His smile didn’t leave as you dropped this news on him, however, and you weren’t sure if it was just the intensity of his eyeliner or if his eyes were a little extra bright now.

“Oh, that’s what most of these charming people said their first day here, don’t worry. You’ll love it with us. You’re free to leave any time, of course, but we’ve just finished your posters! Won’tcha at least give them a look?” The host directed your gaze upwards with a flourish and it was then that you saw what he was talking about. Plastered onto the side of a bus was the image of a man exhaling clouds of Halloween orange and chimney red with bright yellow text scrawled below:

**THE UNFORGETTABLE FRANKIE FIREBALL**

You stumbled back a step, shaking the host away from your body, now tense and tingling a bit at the edges.

“When did you...when did you make that? Why...I only just got here.”

“Oh, don’t you worry one bit,” he reassured you, songlike, “we had plenty of extra time and we wanted to do something nice for you, a welcoming gift of sorts! Don’tcha like it, Frankie dear?”

“Extra time?”

“I would certainly hope so!” He extended an arm, his fingers spreading like all-knowing branches, and tugged his sleeve up to the elbow. Sure enough, you saw that he had not one or two, but four watches on this wrist. Not one of them was ticking, not any of the 12 hands moving even a little bit.

“Yes. It seems we’re right on track, even with your gift.”

Your discomfort had moved forward now from the back burner to the front right burner, coincidentally the one that your wife used the most when she cooked, not that it mattered. You broadened your stiff shoulders, sizing up a man who was easily half a foot taller than you, though the hair added a couple inches too. He still had a shimmering grin that made your stomach turn, and his eyes were not pleading but were insistent. Here you stood, almost toe-to-toe with a freak of a man who didn’t seem to understand that Halloween wasn’t a year-round holiday. 

“Now listen here, I don’t know who you are, but I do know that I will not be made a fool of-”

“We’re not makin’ you a fool, we’re making you work with fire. We’ve already got fools. Three different clowns, in fact.”

“Listen! Where I come from, people respect Mr. Frank O’Brien. I’m a hardworking man, after all. I’ve put in the effort and made a name for myself. To be frank with you-”

“I see what you did there.”

“I’m not... Listen, please! To be frank with you, I don’t have the time for this bullshit. I’m leaving and-”

You stopped again, not interrupted verbally, but instead physically. The host had pulled up his sleeve again upon hearing the word “time.”

“FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WON’T YOU JUST LISTEN?”

“Yes?” Still smiling with either devilishness or plain stupidity, he turned his attention back to you. You took a deep, bone-rattling breath, the air still cold and damp.

“I don’t know what you want, but I’m going to be leaving and I would like my bag back.”

He reached his right arm out toward you, but continued to hold your bag in his left. 

“Charmed to meet you, Frankie, as strange as you might be. I’m Potter Bliss, simply called Bliss ‘round here. Perhaps you’d like to join me for a drink while we go over the details of your working here?”

You refused to shake his hand, leaving him no choice but to stride off toward a garish scarlet trailer, your bag still in his hand and you following, a string of profane comments in tow. The clouds above you sat heavy in the sky, pushing each of your hurried steps down into the mud. Your suede shoes were suffering nearly as much as your patience, and you still didn’t have an umbrella. If it were to start raining again, well that might just be the final straw.
