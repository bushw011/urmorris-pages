The fall semester this year had only just begun, and I found myself falling into place with my schedule quite quickly. I never really believed in karma or anything like that, but I must have done something right this summer, as two of my professors’ office hours overlapped at the most convenient time. Things were perfect, or at least they would have been perfect if it weren’t for the construction in the Humanities building. Sigh. Sure, all my professors had temporary offices that I could have gone to, but I, in my usual state of confusion, never wrote down where they were. I figured I could just wait until Humanities was fixed to bother all of them...until the time came to have a chat with David Ericksen. Knowing that I needed to find his temporary office, I quickly sent an email explaining the situation. A response followed right away, stating that he could be found in “HFA 139, all the way back and to the left.” I made my way to the HFA, wishing I remembered what any of the room numbers there were.

There comes a point in everyone’s life where they become very well accustomed to the buildings on their campus. Sure, I had classes in the HFA, but I never really pulled my head out of the clouds enough to look at my surroundings. There could be a 6-foot-tall tarantula wearing flip-flops at the other end of the hall and I would still hurry off to class, probably listening to music, and completely ignore the oddity. A reasonable person would know that there never really was a room 139 in the HFA, but I was never a reasonable person. 

It took me 10 minutes of looking at a map on the wall and 10 minutes of wandering to realize that maybe there wasn’t a room 139 here to be found. Slowly, I strolled along the studio arts rooms, watching the numbers on the wall increase. Sure enough, there was room 135 and room 140, but not what I was seeking out. This was odd, but not quite odd enough for me to question it. Again, I have always been an unfocused person, so I blamed myself for the mixup. Back I went, retracing my steps, the heels of my brown boots clicking on the floor. Over and over I counted, stopping each time at 140. I had grown frustrated now, and stared down that awful one-four-zero that seemed to be mocking me. 

“He did say 139, I’m sure of it,” I mumbled to nobody in particular. Deep in thought, I took a seat on the floor and rested my back against the cold wall to think. My first thought was that, perhaps, the room I was looking for was in fact room 39, and that there had just been a typo in the email. It seemed logical enough, and would probably make a funny story by the time I finally did find David Ericksen. Another possibility was that 139 could have been on the other side of the hall, hidden by some of those weird offices in the back corner. Once again, a very logical assumption, as he had said something about going all the way to the back. I shook myself from this deep moment of thought to find myself face-to-face with something actually quite illogical: a small metal door hidden away in the corner of this little alcove.

The door in front of me was old, made a dark brown-ish metal, and roughly the size of a mini fridge long-forgotten and abandoned beside a residence hall on a hot summer day. Leaning forwards, I was able to make out what was carved into the surface: 139.

“This has got to be a joke, right?” I whispered, hoping I wouldn’t hear an answer. It looked as if I could barely fit through this door. I was well aware that I was a very small person for my age, so if I couldn’t get through, how could a grown man have an office on the other side? I assumed that, bored of waiting for humanities to be fixed, David Ericksen decided to play a prank on his students. Maybe he saw the construction as a chance to take a little extra free time, maybe he was at home playing with his cat, maybe he was relaxing and watching a comedy movie while I was here trying to remember the science behind tetanus. Either way, there was only one way I could ever be sure of this odd room. After all, if I committed to the joke of his and got to the end of it, I could probably brag about my level of commitment to problem-solving. That would show everyone about my dedication as a student and a critical thinker, right?

With an atrocious screech of metal hinges long-ignored, the door opened. I found the door to be heavier than expected. I was also surprised to see that, behind the door, I was not faced with a solid wall. Ahead of me, a full 15 or 20 feet or a dark tunnel extended. At the other end, light and bright colors could be seen.

“What in the world? This all seems a bit much for a joke…” Cautiously, I extended one arm into the darkness. Upon finding that I was not in any immediate danger, I entered the tunnel. Thanks to my size, I was able to comfortably crawl into the light. Once I reached the light, however, I stopped in shock. The room I had just entered, while still smaller than a classroom or office, was big enough for me to stand up in. The brick walls were covered in a variety of small tapestries and the floor had a thick, highly decorative rug. I stood up, dusted myself off, and began making my way to the other side of the small room, where a slightly bigger door could be found. This door, unlike the metal one from before, seemed average in every way. As I reached for the handle, I heard a voice from inside. Though it was quiet, some of the words spoken were distinguishable.

“...pick up more eggs....well-mixed...better not spill it like last time…” Ah! Finally, I had found my professor. It was clear to me that this was his voice, though I was still baffled by his location. From the sound of it, there was some delicious baking going on just inside the door. With my usual energy returning to me and overpowering my confusion, I turned the handle and swung the door open at full speed.

“Are you making snacks for-” I froze, mortified. Sure enough, the man in front of me was the one and only David Ericksen. For some reason, though, he wore a forest-green cloak instead of a sweater, and was standing over a pot boiling on a stove. I stood in the doorway of what looked like a hotel room, but dared not fully enter.

“Oh! Good, you got here just in time. I was wondering if you’d get lost. Tell me, do you just know how to make cheesecakes, or are you well-versed in potions, too?”

“This... is your temporary office?” The words were difficult to get out.

“Well, this campus is sort of my temporary office in life, don’t you think? Sure, I enjoy teaching, but after the first few centuries of it you get really bored. Students these days just don’t care like they used to.”

I tried to speak, but the combination of my lightheadedness and my professor’s excitement allowed him to continue without so much as a single noise from me.

“The Enlightenment, though, LET ME TELL YOU...those kids sure had a passion for reading. We definitely had some good times back in the 18th century,” he reflected, stirring the odd concoction on the stove, “But enough about the good old days. You had something to ask me about?”

Stumbling into the room, I made my way to an uncomfortable desk chair and collapsed into it. Quietly, I forced my next sentence out.

“Actually...I just wanted to talk about my schedule.”
