**By Jon Antonsen, Variety Editor** _originally published in Issue 6, Volume 30 of the University Register on Friday, December 8, 2018._

Rise of the Shitlords is a recount of a Dungeons and Dragons campaign that I run with some friends: our players have been transported from their homeland of Sand Point to a different universe contained within the bowels of the Lost Coast Catacombs. In search of the last Guardian of the Gates, our players are engaged in an interplanar cat-and-mouse chase through spacetime to capture the she-demon Nualia before she unleashes the World Eater unto the universe—destroying everything for a thinly-veiled promise of power in the new world that would come. 

Where we last left our players, they had just found the source of the tainted mead… or did they simply find a distributor? After investigating a suspicious tunnel they found in the cellar of the Wooden Boozer, the tavern wherein they found the barrel containing the mead, the party discovered a ladder which led to a tent in the Slums of Squall’s End. Well, Mices discovered the tunnel. Rather than wait for the party, he bounded up the ladder, unsheathed his sword, and killed the gang members who populated the tent after receiving Bull’s Strength (steroids in spell-form) from Leo the Inspector. 

After the gang had been dealt with, the rest of the party joined Mices in the tent to look for clues. On the body of the gang leader, they found a note with distribution instructions signed by a “W.I.” There was only one W.I. that they could think of: Wa’avera Iliwreak, the patriarch of the prosperous Iliwreak family. However, rather than confront him, they decided to follow the tunnel to unearth the rest of the illegal mead operation—stopping the mead trade was more important than dealing with some slimy businessman. 

The party climbed back into the tunnel and continued into the darkness. The party had their weapons ready, fingers nimble in anticipation. Every creak and dribble of dirt shivered anxiety into their spines. Around every bend, they peered cautiously into the darkness to surprise an enemy that was never there to greet them. After what felt like a mile, the party members arrived at the end of the tunnel. A ladder like the one before greeted them. 

“I’m gonna go, maybe I’ll find my wife!” Mices jumped at the opportunity to be the first one up the ladder. Before anyone could tell him “No, that’s a terrible idea, Mices, you could get us killed,” he pushed through Maer’n, Gerald, Leo, and Three Shiv Mac, put his greatsword between his teeth, and leaped up the ladder to an unknown fate, the cursing and orders from his distraught party members growing increasingly faint. 

“We gotta get up there and make sure Big Stupid doesn’t do anything bad!” Maer’n yelled. The rest of the party agreed, and, as quickly as they could, they barreled up after him. 

The ladder led to an enclosed horse stall. Mices paid no attention to the party’s original task—he was intent on finding his wife. He checked under the hay strewn across the floor, he searched a few of the stalls (one of the stalls didn’t even have a horse in it, just a bunch of barrels), and he even tried to ask the friendly horses if they had seen his wife. Looking back blankly, one of the horses whinnied: “e-e-e-eh-huh-huh.” Since Mices doesn’t speak horse, he committed the sounds to memory and would ask Leo what it meant later. Leo knows everything. 

When the rest of the party arrived in the stall, they saw Mices wandering about frantically tearing the entire barn apart. “Mices, what are you doing?!” Leo accosted. 

“I’m trying to find my wife!” he yelled back. 

“We are on a mission!” Leo called back. “Have you found anything that would help us?!” 

“No,” Mices replied, continuing to rip up the floor. 

Realizing it was an exercise in futility to stop Mices from finding his wife (who isn’t really his wife, but just an Iliwreak Mices saw once and thought was cute), the rest of the party searched around the barn for evidence of tainted mead. Luckily, in the first place he looked, Three Shiv found one stall filled with mead barrels. After detecting its magical properties, it was made clear that these barrels were tainted. But where exactly were these barrels? 

Sensing a commotion from the barn, an Iliwreak farmhand headed towards the horse stalls to see why the horses were so riled up. He didn’t expect to find five big weirdos armed to the teeth, tearing up his master’s barn while also looking at the feed barrels! He quickly hid behind the doorway of the barn and observed this band of hooligans to better understand what to tell the guards. 

That’s when he saw the biggest one of the group grab a few feed barrels and break them against the ground! Only… there wasn’t feed inside them… but mead! In a bout of confusion, the farmhand burst into the barn. “Stop, hooligans!”

The party stopped in horror; they’d been discovered! Before the farmhand could disappear, Gerald, incredibly offended by the charge of hooliganry, grappled the farmhand and pinned him to the ground. Three Shiv promptly muffled the farmhand’s alarmed screams, and Maer’n began to play a song to calm him. After the farmhand had quieted, Leo approached him. 

“Tell us about this mead: Who do you work for? How many guards are there? Where is this place?” Leo inquired. 

The farmhand was puzzled. “The mead is all news to me! I am a farmhand for the Iliwreak Family Farmers Market™, we’ve got—I don’t know—a regular amount of guards?” 

“So Wa’avera is involved,” Leo paused. “How do you not know about the mead? Have you not heard of the fighting occurring in the streets? Have you not seen soldiers bludgeoning each other to death over nothing more than drinks? This was caused by the mead! Tell me where I can find Wa’avera!” 

The farmhand stammered, “Uh, uh, in the store! You’ll be caught by guards before you can ever get there!” 

Putting a dagger to the farmhand’s throat, Three Shiv whispered, “If you distract the guards, we will let you go without killing you.” The farmhand gulped in agreement. 

The party discussed a plan while Gerald watched their captive. After some deliberation, they told the farmhand his role and the party readied themselves at the door of the barn. 

Leo cast ghost image, creating a realistic wolf which ran across the farmfield. The farmhand burst from the door and yelled to the guards guarding the field that the wolf had just tried to kill a horse. In a stroke of luck, the guards believed him and chased after the wolf. 

The party members scurried across the field towards the store, no guards left to stop them. They entered quickly with weapons drawn, looking for Wa’avera. Customers and employees gasped in horror at the sight of the party members. 

“Where’s Wa’avera?” yelled Leo. 

Time passed; the minutes felt like hours. 

Wa’avera entered the store, casually speaking with an employee. When he saw what was going on, he annoyedly looked to the party members. 

“The jig is up, Wa’avera! We know about the mead trade!” Leo yelled. 

“Oh, do you now?” Wa’avera sneered. He looked at his employees. “Kill them!” 

Fireballs, lightning bolts, and arrows flew across the store above crawling customers. Maer’n used her bass guitar’s magical boost (Out-of-game: shout) ability to deafen the store hands, Three Shiv used his bow to strike them from afar, Leo used his sorcerer spell powers to combat the magical prowess of their enemies, and Gerald and Mices threw themselves into battle, slicing into Iliwreak grunts left and right. But it wasn’t enough. Soon, party members began to fall. 

First Maer’n. 

Then Gerald. 

Then Three Shiv. 

Leo and Mices were close to death. It seemed as though the world would end. 

Until Fate (Me, the Dungeon Master) decided to be nice to them. 

The Iliwreak farm is situated close to the soldier’s camp. Just outside of the Iliwreak camp was the tent which Davor and Kaye shared. After a time of intimate love-making, they rested in their tent waiting to be summoned by the party. Outside of the tent they heard footsteps, and then they saw a glowing wolf rush past them, followed closely by some guards. Quickly dressing themselves, they looked out of their tents toward the direction from which the guards and wolf came. At the farm, heading across a field, they saw their friends sneaking into a store. Kaye convinced Davor that they were in trouble and they’d probably need the healing power of a cleric in a bit. She was very right. 

Davor and Kaye burst through the store’s backdoor and used their magical powers to help kill the store hands. Using his channel energy power, Davor was able to restore health to many of the party. The battle took a decisive turn and soon all enemies were defeated, and Wa’avera lay barely alive in a pool of his own blood. 

A newly-invigorated Gerald picked up the limp man and pinned him against a wall. He squirmed in agony. Leo approached and took a swig from his flask (Out-of-game: giving him bonuses to his detective skills). 

“Are there any more distribution centers for the tainted mead?” Leo asked. 

“If you followed the tunnel and found your way this far, then I assume that Aymer is dead. There are no more centers,” Wa’avera responded. 

“You’re gonna rot in a jail cell for the rest of your life,” Leo responded. The town guards entered the destroyed store, causing a ruckus while securing the area and evacuating civilians caught in the crossfire. 

A guard approached Leo and requested to take Wa’avera. Leo told him to wait, then turned back to Wa’avera. “Before I give you to the authorities, I have one question: why did you do it?” 

“My family used to have a brewery which made the best craft brews. When Nualia came, she tainted our honey and barley and left us with nothing! I had to do what I had to do to keep my family’s name relevant in the town’s booze. We needed the money.” 

Gerald released his grip on Wa’avera and the guards took him away. On his way out, one of the guards spat in Wa’avera’s face. “Your mead killed my friend!” 

“What! That’s impossible unless he drank too much!” Wa’avera responded angrily. 

“Your tainted mead would kill anyone who drank a sip! That’s how magic works, you imbecile!” 

Wa’avera was confused. “What do you mean ‘that’s how magic works?’ There wasn’t any spell on the mead!” Then it hit him; Nualia had poisoned the mead. 

He began to sob. 

The party was escorted back to the Magistrate’s tent where they were greeted with fanfare—they had succeeded in bringing peace back to Squall’s End (Out-of-game: kind of. They broke the campaign really early on and skipped about three-quarters of the story, but they effectively solved many of the problems of Squall’s end). The Magistrate was incredibly grateful for their help and offered to the party members their chance to go onwards through the Catacombs. A battalion of soldiers had been sent to the jungle to retrieve the statue for the party. While they were away, the party was offered lodging. 

The next day, the party awoke with a start and gathered in the lobby of the lodge at which they stayed. However, Mices was mysteriously absent. Maer’n went looking and found him in his room, looking solemnly down at a new sword in his lap. He hadn’t slept. Maer’n tried to ask what was wrong, but she couldn’t get a clear answer from him. Unbeknownst to the rest of the party, Mices had just lost his wife. This will be the subject of another story. 

Back at the Magistrate’s tent, the Magistrate wished the party well on their travels. From behind a curtain, the guards brought forth the monkey statue which would send them into the next level of the Lost Coast Catacombs. 

In excitement, all the party members touched the statue. 

They were sucked into a vortex, their bodies skewing and awash with all sorts of color. 

In an instant, they were spat out into… into nothing. They were floating in a black ocean of night sky, drowning and bloating! But they weren’t in water. A glowing, blue marble floated beneath them, however it wasn’t an ordinary marble. It had clouds. And land. Was that… was that a world beneath them? It was; the players didn’t know it, but they were slowly suffocating in outer space. 

Join us next semester to see how they get out of this predicament and to discover where they are.
