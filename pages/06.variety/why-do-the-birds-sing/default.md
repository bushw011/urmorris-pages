The boy, he must have been only 7 or so, pressed his hands against the window. He marvelled at the newly visible colors that poked through the sludge left behind as February faded away. I, having only just returned home, lingered in the garden. Not long after the boy, another figure approached the window. This one was older, her face was not as full of color as the boy’s, and her once honey-colored hair was now grey and thin. I couldn’t hear a word the boy said, but the grin that creeped across his round face seemed to confirm that he was pointing out the new plants to her. She nodded, joining him in watching over the garden. 

If only I could ask them to join me. I could show them all of the life to be seen from above the trees, and not just through the old kitchen window. Oh, how that would make the boy laugh. 

I waited just next to what would soon be roses and contemplated moving closer. I wondered just what it would take to grab their attention. As if on cue, the old woman extended a finger, pointing- was she pointing to me? I watched as she gently lifted the window, just enough for me to hear the boy. 

“Grandma, which one is that?” 

I readjusted, holding my head high. If the boy noticed me, perhaps I could make him also notice all that spring had to offer. 

“That one? By the bushes? That’s a red-winged blackbird. Beautiful creatures, but they’re quite noisy!” She let out a warm, rolling laugh as the boy rested his chin on the windowsill. This was it. It seemed the boy and the woman had noticed me. Now it was just a matter of bringing them closer. “Come outside,” I wanted to yell to them, “everything is much more colorful up here!” 

Alas, the woman stepped away from the window, soon followed by the boy. It was almost time for lunch, after all.
