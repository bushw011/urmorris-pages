In a forest, quietly shining, the sun dances down through the foliage above to show the path you need to take. You came here long ago, maybe just a year or two before you were born. The forest seems to have remained the same. 

It is not long before you find yourself toe-to-toe with a quiet but familiar creek. He does not tell you which way to go, so you turn left, following each delicate curve back to the source of the water. You have never touched the water, perhaps out of respect, or perhaps out of fear. You do not cross the water, for it is not time yet. Breaths of silver and gold slide down the sunbeams. You know this slight warm breeze is supposed to feel calming and protective. It is not clear quite yet if you agree or even if this breeze will remain. 

Each soft step, one foot in front of the other, brings you somewhere closer to this curious land you’ve missed so much, despite never seeing it during the span of your life. Scratching at the coldest corners of your lonely, empty mind, you know what to next look for. Reciting this path in your head is easy, though all the words are simply mistaken glimpses at someone else’s memories. First the creek, follow it back, look for the swings, look for the statue…

You know where you are going. Here, the moss grows thicker and softer, decorating the walls of trees that line nature’s hallway. The dirt beneath you is gentle, no sticks or rocks to make the path bumpy, and everything is silent. Though the leaves and branches sway in the afternoon breeze, you neither feel nor hear any wind. The water in the creek is flowing the opposite direction of the path you are walking, but you cannot hear its movement. Here, you are alone.

Finally, you reach the clearing, though you do not enter just yet. The grass is deafeningly green and the water just as blue. Your eyes crawl over the pristine swing set with its ever-unmoving swing, the full rose bushes that surround the shining marble bench, and the statue on the far side. All is how you remembered it. All is beckoning to you, begging you to come in and rest. You wonder if that little stone cherubim would wink if you were to look away. You wonder if he’s the one calling to you. 

This is supposed to be a calming place, this you know. It does feel, however, a little too empty and quiet, much like a hotel hallway after all the residents have gone to bed, leaving nobody to converse with besides the buzz of the ice machine. The sunlight that trickles in and lights the final stretch of your path, while glimmering and golden, offers no warmth. The air around you is not warm nor cold, fast nor slow, or reacting in any way to your presence. You are surrounded with hollow nothingness, stretching out past your fingertips and past all that you understand. This place, like you, is simply empty. 

Carefully, you cross through the middle of the clearing. You take a seat on the marble bench and allow yourself to let out a sigh. You hadn’t really realized you were holding your breath the whole time. Time will not touch this comfortably numb space. You stay here, breathing in the silence. This is a place you had always longed to remember, so it is but a blessing that you have finally arrived.
