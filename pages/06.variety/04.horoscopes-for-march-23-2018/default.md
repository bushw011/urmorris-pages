**By Christian Pfeiffer, Editor in Chief** _uploaded at 8:41 a.m. on Friday, March 23, 2018._

**Aries (Mar. 21 - Apr. 19):** This week’s mandatory listening is “Source” by Fever the Ghost, the gentle crackling of Rice Krispies coated in milk, and your lab partner shouting “OH GOOD GOD, NO. NOOO! YOU’VE DOOMED US ALL!”

**Taurus (Apr. 20 - May 20):** So yes, while it is normally true that you should do unto others as you would have them do unto you, keep in mind that not everyone wants to dress up like Pounce and do that thing with a curling iron that you like.

**Gemini (May 21 - Jun. 20):** THE UMM STUDENT ORGANIZATION LEADERSHIP NETWORK LISTSERV (UMMSOLN) IS A NETWORK FOR UMM STUDENT ORGANIZATION LEADERS. PLEASE STOP EMAILING ME ABOUT THINGS THAT DON’T PERTAIN DIRECTLY TO STUDENT ORGS AND THEIR LEADERS.

**Cancer (Jun. 21 - Jul. 22)**: I’m not gonna lie to you, the stars are telling me your next few weeks are gonna be boring af. If I were you, I’d start brainstorming some scandalous rumors about other people so you have something to keep you busy when the time comes.

**Leo (Jul. 23 - Aug. 22):** Did you know Variety Editor Jon Antonsen wears crocs because he’s convinced they give him the ability to see the ultraviolet spectrum? Kinda whack-a-doodle if you ask me…

**Virgo (Aug. 23 - Sep. 22):** Later this week you’re gonna be on Facebook and stumble across a link to a list of disturbing fan theories about your favorite childhood TV shows and I cannot recommend strongly enough that you don’t click on it. All you’re gonna do is hear about how Scooby Snacks were actually rocks of crack and how Doug Dimmadome, owner of the Dimmsdale Dimmadome, is the personification of bulimia, and you don’t need that kind of stress right now.

**Libra (Sep. 23 - Oct. 22):** Friendly reminder that whatever issues you may be dealing with, whatever problems keep you up at night, stressing and worrying, whatever is currently happening in your life that you don’t like, you don’t have to deal with it alone. My rate is $10/hour and I have yet to meet a problem I couldn’t solve with a little elbow grease, a tennis racket, and a car battery.

**Scorpio (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21):** There needs to be fewer cat and dog people in the world and more Pleistocene beaver people.

**Sagittarius (Nov 22. - Dec. 21):** The best way to combat bullying is to tell your bullies that you wet your pants on purpose.

**Capricorn (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19):** Hi! Billy Mays here for OxiClean, the stain specialist, powered by the air you breathe, activated by the water that you and I drink.

**Aquarius (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18):** Take some time for yourself this weekend and read that book you’ve been meaning to for months now but “haven’t had the time.” You can’t pretend you don’t want to know what happens next to Curious George.

**Pisces (Feb. 19 - Mar. 20):** Around 2.5 billion years ago, the Earth was completely underwater. In hindsight, I probably shouldn’t have shown your mom my dank meme collection.
