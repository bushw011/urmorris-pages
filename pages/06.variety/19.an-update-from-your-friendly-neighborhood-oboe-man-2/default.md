A new semester brings a variety of new music to Morris, as well as plenty of new musicians. Each fall, Morris’ Jazz Ensemble, Symphonic Winds, and Concert Choir perform a short Homecoming concert in order to preview the three highly talented ensembles. This showcase of Morris’ ensembles features two different musical selections from each group, and though it is only 50 minutes of music, it is sure to be a wonderful way to kick off this new school year. The Homecoming concert is free to all who plan on attending. The concert will be held on Saturday, September 22 at 4 p.m. in the Humanities Fine Arts Recital Hall.

For those who are ready to start this semester’s performances off even earlier than Saturday, September 22, the Jazz Ensemble will be beginning their monthly jam sessions this upcoming Tuesday, September 18 at 7:30 p.m. at Old No. 1 Bar and Grill. These jam sessions are free to attend and are a very fun and laid-back way to get to watch one of Morris’ groups perform. Additionally, there will be a free public event held at the Morris Public Library where the Jazz Ensemble, under the direction of Jonathan Campbell, will be offering an interactive and child-oriented presentation, followed by a concert. The Jazz Ensemble’s first main concert, besides Homecoming, will be Friday, November 30 at 7:30 p.m.

For Symphonic Winds, what is perhaps most exciting this semester is the WWI Armistice Centenary Commemoration Concert. Symphonic Winds and the Concert Choir, under the direction of Simon Tillier and Bradley Miller respectively, will perform a varied selection of works alongside readings from students and faculty to commemorate the ending of the First World War. This free concert will be held in the Morris Elementary School Concert Hall on Sunday, November 11 at 3 p.m.

Throughout the month of October, there will be seven performances, including guest artist Dr. Emilie Amriem, a percussion faculty recital by Dr. Scott Horey, a faculty Chamber Music concert, and many more wonderful opportunities to support the various music groups on campus.
