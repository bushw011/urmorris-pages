The summer I graduated high school I got a job as a night stocker at a grocery store. It was a crappy job where I would spend all night in the store putting product up on the shelves from midnight to seven in the morning. It didn’t help that the store was in the middle of the slums so I was constantly worrying that someone might break in during my shift. This was not the ideal job for me but I did it anyway for the pay I needed for college.

One night, after stocking the dairy section, I heard a banging coming from the front of the building. Standing about twelve feet from the door I saw a guy with his face pressed against the window trying to look around. After seeing me, the guy began to wave at me like he was trying to get my attention. At first, I thought he was a co-worker that got locked out, but when I got closer, I realized he wasn’t an employee I recognized.

The man was poorly dressed with a shabby beard and clothes filled with holes. He smiled at me, revealing a mouth missing at least half of his teeth, and said, “Kid let me in. I needs to get ma prescription.” The man then dug out a piece of paper from his pocket and pressed it to the glass door. It was some kind of prescription pad and we did have a pharmacy in the store, but, being that it was four in the morning, it was obviously closed.

I approached the situation carefully and as politely as I possibly could. I said to him, “I am sorry sir but the store is closed if you come back around nine today we will gladly help you.”

The man glared at me and just responded, “Open the fucking store now you little shit.” He then started pounding on the glass as hard as he could and demanded that I let him in. I decided to just ignore him and go back to work. He yelled more insults at me calling me something along the lines of “little shit.” Thinking he was just some tweaker, I assumed he would just tire himself out eventually and go home. I was wrong. About ten minutes later I heard a crashing sound coming from the front of the store.

I rushed up towards the entrance and ducked behind a display in one of the aisles. I could see a pile of glass on the floor where the windows once were. The man threw a trashcan through the window and now walked in looking pissed off. He walked away into the direction he saw me walk after I left him. The second the guy was out of sight I ran into the storage room and left the building through the emergency exit. I ran across the parking lot in less than five seconds to get into my car. I drove several blocks away before I pulled out my phone to dial 911.

I knew the guy probably set off the alarm when he broke the glass but I still wanted to make sure he got caught. The police arrived on the scene about five minutes after I left and arrested the guy. When the man was arrested, the police confirmed he was high on meth at the time and when they found him he had a loaded handgun. I quit that job the next day and even to this day I don’t regret it.
