Some entry-level products are a good buy. Sunglasses you know you’ll lose eventually, chapstick, and even pencils and pens. Altec Lansing’s Mini H20 bluetooth speaker is not an entry-level product that is worth your money. 

I bought the product at its regular price of $40 and owned it for nearly three hours. I found the device to be startlingly small. Small enough to fit in the palm of my hand, which was pretty neat. Its frame had the usual feel for most bluetooth speakers; a rubbery cover that hides the plastic frame, and wire mesh covering the speakers. The waterproofing was also a welcomeed addition. 

The first thing I noticed about the device was the notice I received when I turned it on. It was very loud, and told me exactly what I already knew: I had just turned the device on. I found this to be annoying and unnecessary, especially when other devices from the same time period either didn’t have this notice, or had a series of low volume beeps, or even a musical phrase like Jawbone’s entry-level addition. Altec Lansing’s offer with this product was disruptive and unnerving. 

Pairing took a while the first time as the device struggled to connect to my phone, (and the device told me several times that it was pairing in the process) but after the first time, it ceased to be an issue. The aux cable provided also worked, but seemed to be included more as an afterthought, as it had visible seams from production on either jack. 

At lower volume, the sound seemed to be adequate, or better than my phone’s speaker, which I’d grown accustomed to putting on the seat of my car when I drove. However, when the volume drew above speaking volume, I began to notice crackling and distortion of audio, especially whenever there was supposed to be a bass tone. That being said, it was loud, but nothing that I wanted to listen to. 

After thinking about how the device sounded some more, I decided to return it. I actually felt bad to own the speaker, and embarrassed that I’d spent $40on something like it. Luckily, BestBuy allowed me to return it. 

Though the concept behind the H20 Mini is solid, and Lansing’s upper tier products perform much better, the only reason one should buy the H20 Mini is if they want to sacrifice sound quality for waterproofing. Then again, even for that, there are better options on the market.
