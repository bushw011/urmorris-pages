The man stumbled down the sickeningly bright hallway, one hand on the wall in failed efforts to stay stable. He heard the two voices behind him, gaining on him, searching for him. He tried to go faster, tasting iron in his mouth. Footsteps rounded the corner, going faster now. The man, now scrambling madly, knew they were close behind him… that they were hunting him. A voice shouted for him to stop, which only made him speed up. A gunshot rang through the air. Darkness.



“Owen, are you still up?”

A young boy, no more than 8 years old, sat in his bed, clutching a small stuffed animal to his chest.

“I can’t sleep, Dad. I had a bad dream!”

“Again?” His father left the door open as he entered the room and sat at the foot of the bed. The room was dim, one small light on top of the dresser bathing their faces in a warm orange glow. The boy looked at his father’s shirt, his face scrunched in frustration.

“The things in your dreams are only your imagination, Owen. You have to tell yourself that there’s no such thing as monsters. Besides, you’ve got your tiger here to protect you!”

The father gestured at the stuffed tiger, which was a bit scruffy, the fur worn down in places.

The boy remained silent, a frown still stuck on his round face.

“I’m sorry I have to go into work tonight. I’ll be back soon, I promise. Mom’s downstairs if you need her, alright?”
Owen nodded, but continued to sit in silence. His father kissed him on the forehead, readjusted the soft blue blankets, and quietly left. Minutes passed, but Owen did not lie down. He won’t sleep, he can’t sleep. Outside, the rain began to splash against the window as the boy fought his exhaustion.

Darkness.



The squad car pulled up to curb, the man inside mumbling under his breath about how “all these damn suburban houses look the same; am I even at the right house?” He’d never been to this house, though he worked with the man inside for years now. He had difficulty understanding this odd sense of familiarity, of not-quite-deja-vu. HIs partner, Officer Monoghan, climbed into the car, slamming the door.

“Sorry for making you pick me up. My boy has been having trouble sleeping, and it’s hard for him when I leave.”

“Owen, right?” asked the man. He didn’t know how how he knew this name.

“Um...yeah, actually. He’s getting big now. Hopefully he’ll outgrow this.” Officer Monoghan had a slight surprised smile, but he still looked tired. That’s just what happened to a person’s energy when they work cases like these.

“What is the situation tonight? I heard it’s potentially dangerous.”

The man began to drive.

“Some sick son of a bitch locked himself in an empty elementary school with a woman he’s holding hostage.”

Monoghan shook his head in disgust.

“He killed her,” the man spit, bluntly. He knew it was true, not just because he was told by his superiors, but because he felt her pain. It wasn’t something he could properly explain to those he worked with.

Arriving at the school, the man parked the car.

“Let’s go,” he sighed, leaning back against his seat.

Silently, his fellow officer handed him his gun.

The first thing the two men saw as they stepped inside the building was the trail of the victim’s blood pooled in the bright hallway. Ahead, they heard the rushed, chaotic footsteps of the man they were looking for.
