“Whuh…what am I doing here?”

I awoke with a start, a cold sweat running down my back. My hair was in my face, and drenched in sweat. I pushed it out of my eyes, only to find myself in a dimly lit room, sitting in a chair with the faint smell of popcorn. I looked at my hands, and saw a faint red smear on them. I touched my forehead, and after a soft *squish* I felt an amount of blood come pouring out of my head. I screamed. 

“Relax, man, you’re fine.”

I looked next to me and saw a rather handsome man with long hair, blue eyes, and a pair of peace-sign-shaped glasses. He looked a lot like me, now that I think about it. Same build, same hair color, eye color…he even…kinda smelled like me. 

“What do you mean I’m fine? There’s a fucking hole with blood coming out of my head!” 

“You think that’s bad, man?” he said, lifting his arm and pulling back his sleeve to reveal a number of holes in his arm and a long, curved slice. “The government tried to silence me during a protest, man!”

“Wait…” I said, quickly remembering the last moments of my life. An argument with my fiancée, a few screams, some shuffling in a desk, and an M9 that I don’t remember how she got. “Am I…dead??”

“Yes, you are,” another voice chimed in. I turned and saw another man, darker skinned with long hair and blue eyes, wearing a uniform of gold and silver, with a tall, slender crown that had an eagle on it. He wore some really rad sandals, too. 

“Who are you?” I asked.

“I’m Relaphanau the Pharaoh of Egypt. Pleasure to meet you, Matthias.”

“How do you know my name?” I asked. The hippie turned to me.

“We all know you, man!” he said, “I’m Louis, by the way, but everyone calls me “Pooey Louie” cause I always smell like…y’know, man…the good green?”

I was really confused. I looked around the room and saw more men and women who looked quite similar to me. They were all of varying ages; one was way younger, barely out of kindergarten; a lot of them were old, and looked like they’d seen a lot of shit. Very few of them were close to my age, except for Louis and Relaphanau.

“It was your movie,” one of the elderly people who looked like me said, “it was a classic! That twist at the end with your girlfriend? Ho! Such tragic love!”

“What do you mean ‘my movie?’” I asked. Louis gave a light nudge on my shoulder.

“Our movie, bruh! The life and times of all of our past lives and future lives, man!” I looked at Relaphanau. 

“Is this true?”

“I was the first,” he said. “‘Twas quite lonely to sit in here for some time alone, but then I bore witness to Kielpher up top and it was an interesting watch. He joined me soon hereafter, and we realized all who die come to watch the next life play out.”

A woman with long brown hair and the most gorgeous blue eyes I’d ever seen sat next to me. She didn’t have a leg.  “Besides, it’s always interesting to see who shows up.” 

“Really?” I asked. I was about to ask her if she was seeing anybody now that I was single, but one of the kids who was younger than I was shushed me. 

“It’s about to start! Don’t talk during the movie!”

I looked hesitantly at the screen. The faint whirr and buzz of the film reel could be heard from the back, and the light cascaded into the room as the lamps on the side began to dim. The opening credits played.

_2018, April 15th. Ethan Walker, Age 45. Marilyn Walker, Age 43. Together, they bore a daughter..._

Louis nudged me. “It’s always interesting to see where the girls end up, usually it’s boring for the first sixteen years or so, and then it gets really good!” His skeevy eyes sent a shiver down my spine. I didn’t really want to know what he meant. Whatever, I’d figure it out. I placed my hands on the armrests next to me, and felt a bag of freshly popped popcorn covered in seasoned salt in one hand, and in the other a super big gulp cup. I took a sip, fresh Coke. I loved that taste. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad in here, I thought.

The film played out for a while. The daughter, Carolyn, was a normal kid. She learned to crawl, walk, eat, write, read, like any other child. It started to get boring when all we did was watch her sleep, though. After a while I asked Relaphanau how much of the movie was left. He shrugged.

“All depends on when the great Divine wills it to be.” I asked how long we’d been watching, and he told me only 7 years. On average a film was usually around 80 years, except for that one short film a few showings earlier. 

Carolyn grew up, went to school, made friends, got bullied, a lot like I did actually, and found love. She went to college, went into the Marine Corps, and fought in some meaningless war America started. It was shocking to watch her life play out before our eyes. The people she’d killed, the lives she’d ruined. I asked Mandy (the girl next to me) if there were any other theaters like this one. She nodded.

“One of the first humans is over in the next theater. Caveman guy. Real buff. Probably has a big-”

“SHHHHHHH” Louis whispered, “I think it’s about to end!”

Carolyn was prone, crawling through an open field. Her arm had been horribly wounded, and her eyes were bloodshot. She cried, and let out a single word before she collapsed on the ground. “Charlie…”

The film reel cut to black, and the lights dimmed. Applause, even from me. Her performance brought me to tears. She had lived such a short life…much like I did, actually. The lights were brought back up, and I saw that everyone had returned to their initial seats. And right next to me, was a new woman, with brown hair and blue eyes. She clutched at her leg, and screamed. I looked her straight in the eyes.

“Relax, it’s okay. I’m Matthias, I’m the guy before you. Here for the show? It’s about to start…”
