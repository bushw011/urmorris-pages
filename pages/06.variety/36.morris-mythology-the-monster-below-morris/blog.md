At first glance, Morris can come across as nothing more than a quaint little college town. This is especially true for anyone who has lived in large cities prior to being in Morris. Sure, the prairie has its fair share of hidden gems, maybe a charming movie theater or a friendly co-op, but the truth of the matter is that there will always be a secret or two that goes unnoticed. We all have monsters that we don’t share with others, but are these monsters always bad? Certainly not. Humans rely so heavily on binaries that simply cannot explain what really happens in the world. The only explanations that we can hold on to are the stories that we have, though this may sound cheesy. This is a story of confusion, mistaken identities, self-love, and badass super powers.

An unremarkable Monday morning bled through into an unremarkable Monday afternoon and later into an unremarkable Monday evening. This was not a bad thing, of course, as inspiration could be found through the quiet moments in life. I always enjoyed walking home from work anyway. Most nights I walked home from work, I found it quicker to leave through the back door of the restaurant and cut through alleys. This night was no different, or at least not at first. I had my headphones in and was shuffling through some Tom Waits songs, selecting them in some goofy moment of musical indifference. I suppose this detail didn’t matter in the context of what was about to happen, but at the time I had nothing on my mind besides the music I was listening to. After all, what was there for me to worry about in a town like Morris?

It wasn’t until I was walking past some dumpsters behind some store that I noticed something was off. Despite the wall of music around my head, I heard what sounded like an animal, angry and in pain. Must be a stray cat. Hope it’s okay...I do love cats. I didn’t put too much thought into this, though, as Morris has just a ridiculous amount of stray cats and other little animals. As I continued past the building, I realized that the sound was not coming from inside or behind the dumpster at all, instead echoing out from a storm drain to the other side of me. Now, I’ve never seen It (nor do I care to) and I don’t know many other stories that revolve around weird things in the sewers, but I knew that something wasn’t right. Something about the twisted yowling was beginning to make my skin crawl. Had I known any better, I probably would have continued walking, maybe turning my music louder in the process.

Though I was still moving in the direction of home, my attention was elsewhere, was here at the curb, creeping and oozing into the storm drain. I did not move closer, but kept my eyes locked firmly on the opening. After a few quick moments the sounds slowed to a stop and I stopped along with them. Hopefully nobody had noticed that this relatively small distance had taken me several minutes to cross as curiosity held me in place. Upon confirming that the noises were gone, I took up my walk home once again. In my moment of nosiness I hadn’t realized how cold the air had gotten. I dug my hands into my coat pockets and picked up the pace, now speed-walking home. This brisk walk was not a desire to find something; this was no wine-mom-in-the-Mall-of-America walk. More than anything, I wanted to get out of the cold. Each step felt slightly faster than the last, and in my haste I turned the corner sharply, for which I blame my days of color guard back in high school. This turn, however, nearly crashed me directly into someone else who was hurrying away from the building just as quickly as me.

In a truly midwestern fashion, I let out a surprised “ope!” and clumsily sidestepped. Composing myself in that moment, I realized that the person I had nearly thrown to the ground was my creative writing professor, Angela Hume. 

“Desmond? Oh! You really startled me there,” laughed Angela.

“Sorry. Yeah, sorry. I’m...I got a bit distracted there. Some weird animal or something and it was making a noise and-”

“Well I certainly haven’t heard any animals around here, but I think you and I may be looking for the same person, or at least, the same entity.”

As I previously stated, I had not been looking for anything that night other than an escape from the cold, but this statement from Angela brought back my curiosity, which must have been noticeable. 

“You know about it too, don’t you? What wonderful energy,” she beamed. “The world might be full of some frightening things, but I’ve got a good feeling about this energy. I don’t know if others are as attuned to this, but it’s...it’s somewhat empowering, isn’t it?”

I had no answer, and I could not even begin to comprehend what was going on, but I knew that Angela would never lead me astray. 

“Sorry, you must be a bit confused. You know what, you should stop by my office hours. I’ll find a way to better explain things. I’ve been looking into this radical energy for a while now, and there’s something about the vibes that I’m giving. It sounds silly, doesn’t it? I know there must be more to this person, whoever it is that is calling out to us. Anyway, I’ll see you.”

With a nod, she left me to wonder what this interaction was about. I can see how this would sound strange from an outside perspective, but I was not too worried. Don’t get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for all my professors, but it takes a certain kind of person to go into creative writing. All writing professors seem to have their fair share of charming oddities. It was most likely the case that Angela and I were talking about two entirely different things and that, as I worried about some sickly raccoon or something, she was genuinely trying to share some sort of research with me.

I cleared my head of the conversation and returned home, but did lock into my mind a plan to question Angela further about what “energy” she was trying to convince me to care about.
