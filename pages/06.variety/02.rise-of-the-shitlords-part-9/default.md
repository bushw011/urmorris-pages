Rise of the Shitlords is a recount of a Dungeons and Dragons campaign that I run with some friends. Our players have been transported from their homeland of Sand Point to a different universe contained within the bowels of the Lost Coast Catacombs. In search of the last Guardian of the Gates, our players are engaged in an interplanar cat-and-mouse chase through spacetime to capture the she-demon Nualia before she unleashes the World Eater unto the universe—destroying everything for a thinly-veiled promise of power in the new world that would come.

In our previous installment, Mices had summoned the wrath of the now-humiliated Captain Yu of Talos 13—a highly advanced space station populated by humans. Mices managed to escape before Captain Yu’s guards captured and killed him. He then made his way up to the main level of the station, ran into a scientist who tricked Mices into alerting the guards to his position, before finding himself in a manufacturing facility of sorts. After proving his worth as an employee, the floor manager offered Mices a hiding place in exchange for work. Mices agreed. During this time, however, what happened to the rest of the party?
Where we last left our adventurers (sans Mices), Captain Yu’s guards had just affixed explosive collars to the adventurers’ necks while pointing large, blinking staffs at them. They were not in a good spot. But, due to a persuasive argument brought forth by Leo (Out of game: due to rolling a natural 20 on a diplomacy check), Captain Yu was convinced to allow the party to move about the station while under close surveillance. If any member of the party screwed up, their collars would detonate—taking off their heads with a subtle “pop.”

Before leaving, Captain Yu turned to the party members, his face shadowed menacingly. “You have one chance. You may roam freely about the station, but when we return to Earth in a few days you will be sent to a facility to be studied… unless you can prove to me that you’re worth something.”

The guards put down their weapons and moved out of the doorway to allow Captain Yu to pass. Captain Yu motioned after his guards to follow him down the hallway until they disappeared around a corner.
The party members were left in awe of what just happened: their big, stupid fighter Mices had escaped into the bowels of a scary space station, the Captain of said station was ready to kill all them with a touch of a button, and they didn’t know what to do in the meantime.

After a few moments of silence, the party members dispersed from the Medbay and tried to do something good for the ship. Well, kind of.
Gerald, the paladin, and Maer’n, the elvish bard, went looking for work. They wandered the hallways of the lower level of the station until they came upon a person, clothed in a large, impenetrable white suit, who was carrying a bucket of eels. Intrigued, Gerald and Maer’n followed her until she entered a door. When it opened, the doorway revealed a large room splayed with long tables covered in… eel guts! The two adventurers entered the room, ready to find work.

And shortly, to them work came! A large, burly woman in a similar white suit approached the paladin and bard wielding a butcher’s knife. It’s sharp blade glinted off the flickering lights from above—unnerving the two stewards as she came closer without speaking a word.

“H-hi, we’re looking for work, do you have any?” Maer’n stammered.

Face-to-face with the players, Olga, the head chef of Talos 13, looked the prospective employees up and down and then sniffed loudly. Shortly after, her grimace turned into a smile.

“Yew two look up ta snuff t’ me!” She said in a guttural accent. “Now, at that locker over there, yew’ll find yer clean suits! Then, grab a knife and get-a-cuttin’!”

As Olga said, Gerald and Maer’n entered their suits, grabbed knives, and then began to prepare the eel.

While Gerald and Maer’n were working at the eel processing plant, Kaye and her husband Davor went to the bar. Well, it was more like Kaye went to the bar while Davor wasn’t looking and Davor, confused as to why his wife left him to drink without him, trodded after her.

Taking the elevator field up to the main level, they passed a whole slew of interesting rooms. Near the elevator were the scientific laboratories, the main source of employment on the station. If you were lucky, you might have heard an explosion from one of the labs.

Past the laboratories were the manufacturing plant and the recreation area. The manufacturing plant was behind large steel doors, so they couldn’t see inside (nor could they see Mices), but the recreation area was very open. The ceiling and floor were made of 3 feet of insulated glass—giving users the ability to see the vastness of space below. When Kaye and Davor passed the recreation area, about 12 people were playing a pickup game of volleyball.

Kaye, eager for a drink, yelled into the jumble of amateur volleyball players: “Hey, where can a bitch get a drink?” Her yell startled the players, disrupting the current play and causing one guy to twist his ankle while trying to reach for the wayward volleyball.

“Hey, do you mind keeping it down? We’re playing a game!” Yelled one player at Kaye.

“Hey, do you mind telling me where I can get a drink? I’m trying to forget my day!” She yelled back.

In response, the volleyball-ists pointed in the direction that Kaye and Davor had already been walking. Kaye gave the athletes the good-ol’ Empire State salute and continued down the hallway with Davor.

After passing a boring looking place with books and a very flashy lobby, the two would-be drunkards came to a roundabout. Behind this wall was the dinging hall and bar. This was where they met Gertrude Jefferson: a leather-clad 20-something with short, black hair wielding a double-barreled shotgun.

Kaye and Davor chirped in excitement, landing into bar stools. Kaye tossed two gold pieces onto the bar. “Hit me with the strongest shit you’ve got,” she growled.

Gertrude picked up the gold pieces and nodded in the affirmative. She began to brew the strongest drink she knew: the Pangalactic Gargleblaster (note: gold pieces weren’t accepted currency on the station, but Gertrude took them anyways).

The last player to leave the Medbay was Leo. He decided to explore a little bit—it was his goal to find a library or something. He took a right out of the Medbay and then an immediate left to the elevator, passing the eel processing plant. Now in the main hallway, he took more care than Kaye and Davor by tiptoeing past the sleeping inhabitants of the Personal Chambers, reaching the elevator without disturbing a soul.

Leo then moved past the labs, past the recreation area, and noticed the library on his left. He gleefully entered.

He began to browse the shelves, looking at different books in all sorts of different languages… but the problem was he couldn’t read in any of the languages the books were in!

(Out of game: “common” is not the same as “English”)

While perusing the extensive collection of the library, yearning to find anything he could understand, he overheard a peculiar conversation at a large table in the center of the room.

“Alright you guys, you’ve travelled through an interplanar portal; a long, blindingly blue tunnel shot you guys through space and contorted your bodies. A light at the end of the tunnel appeared and began to increase in size until… Y’all were spat out onto a forest floor at great velocity, rolling across fallen leaves into tree trunks and bushes. Your heads hurt and your eyes are blurry. Upon recovering, you notice that you aren’t in Sandpoint anymore,” a girl with red curly hair shouted.

Leo fixated on one word: “Sandpoint.” That was his hometown.

She continued: “A vast, vibrant green jungle surrounds you on all sides. A beast roars in the distance, a large millipede scurries across Maer’n’s garb and disappears under a bush, and a large multicolored bird caws. You take a minute to gather your bearings, but it isn’t enough time: a beast roars again, this time closer.”

Leo’s eyes widened at the word “Maer’n.”

Things seemed to be going well for the party, but are they really? In the next installment of “Rise of the Shitlords,” we will find out the truth; not only the truth of Talos 13, but of the universe our players find themselves in.
