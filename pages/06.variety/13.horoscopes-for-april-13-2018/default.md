**By Christian Pfeiffer, Editor in Chief** _uploaded at 8:41 a.m. on Monday, April 16, 2018._

_**Aries**_ (Mar. 21 - Apr. 19): The stars aren’t angry with you, they’re just disappointed.

_**Taurus**_ (Apr. 20 - May 20): This week’s mandatory listening is “Flashlight” by Parliament, a lovely baritone emanating from the next stall over, and fresh celery being _cronched_ by your best friend.

_**Gemini**_ (May 21 - Jun. 20): Motor oil is just car butter, change my mind.

_**Cancer**_ (Jun. 21 - Jul. 22): You are beautiful, loved, and worth it. Leos, on the other hand…

_**Leo**_ (Jul. 23 - Aug. 22): You are beautiful, loved, and worth it. Ha! Fooled ya! You read the Cancer horoscope and thought I was gonna be mean! Guess again, dumb fucks!

_**Virgo**_ (Aug. 23 - Sep. 22): So, like, just putting this out there, but that Harry Potter issue we did a couple weeks ago for April Fools? Y’know the one? Well if you liked what you read and somehow missed our many shameless Facebook posts, there’s more. There are like, 15 more articles posted exclusively online at dailyregister.tumblr.com, and you should check them out!

_**Libra**_ (Sep. 23 - Oct. 22): Fun fact: judges don’t say, “order, order in the court!” nearly as often as popular entertainment would make you think! What they DO say a lot are things like “you don’t deserve custody of your children,” and “the defendant still hasn’t shown any serious signs of remorse,” and “who let you get in here with a Super Soaker?”

_**Scorpio**_ (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21): There’s a right way and a wrong way to talk to your children about drugs and alcohol and according to judge Simmons, I did it really, really wrong.

_**Sagittarius**_ (Nov. 22. - Dec. 21): If you’re ever asked which holidays you’d like to have visitation rights to see your kids on, don’t say 4/20 even if you IMMEDIATELY say “jk, jk.” It will already have been too late.

_**Capricorn**_ (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19): Jupiter says if you keep up the good work, he’ll rig the universe to let you pet a dog soon!

_**Aquarius**_ (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18): I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you're looking for anything other than my unconditional love and support, I can tell you I don't have it… but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a great friend for people like you. If you let this self-doubt go now, that will be the end of it—I will not look for you, I will not pursue you... but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you... and I will hug you.

_**Pisces**_ (Feb. 19 - Mar. 20): This is the last horoscope I’m writing for _The UR_. It’s truly been an adventure and thank you, sincerely, for joining me on it. ♥
