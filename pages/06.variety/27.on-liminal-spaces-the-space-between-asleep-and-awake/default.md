There’s something strangely heartbreaking about those dreams that feel so real yet always escape your grasp in the end. These dreams, whether calm or depicting great horrors, exist somewhere where the air is the same temperature as the blood that runs within you, making you feel disconnected and at the same time inseparable from all that you see and hear. 

Step by step, calculating each movement carefully, you may gently tiptoe through a dream of joy and reconnected hearts, your hands reaching out to meet someone else’s, the world around you shining. Maybe it is a holiday. The windowpanes are frosted, the ice spiralling out gracefully, shielding your view from the real world. There is a warm light filling the room, and the way it trickles down from the dark walls makes you want to say that it comes from a fire, but you see no fire anywhere nearby. The room is small and lacking any detail or furnishings whatsoever. This is a temporary space and is unimportant to what you are going through in this moment. You do not need to be present here, as this room is but a waiting room for some greater experience.

You hold the other person close and you squeeze your eyes shut, as you fear that you might open your eyes to find that they are not there. The warmth within you spreads through your limbs and out through your fingers and toes, filling the room with sighs of relief that seem to come from everywhere and nowhere. _Do you hear that?_ you ask the other person. They do not answer. As you hold each other and listen closely, you begin to wonder why it all seems too good to be true. At this point, you have long forgotten that this is a dream. Though you have been asleep for only a few hours, the time you have spent with this person seems to last ages. You measure time not in minutes but instead in each breath that moves through you. Your breaths are deep and long and you find yourself to be relaxed.

Waking from this dream feels like a heavy chain is wrapped around the middle of your torso. Someone is using this chain to pull you up through heavy water that gets colder as your get closer to the surface. Logically, you know this is not how water works. Here, emotions overcome logic and you are nearly frozen by the time you jolt awake; some unseen force pulls you up until you are sitting in bed, hunched over and clutching your chest where the person you miss once was. Now that you are awake, you cannot see their face or remember who they were. You are certain it was someone important to you. You cry a bit as you try to recall, but you know far too well that this is something that will forever exist outside your memories.

Not all dreams transpire in this manner. You know this to be true. There have been nights where the shadows flicker in the corners of your vision. You are afraid to close your eyes and go to sleep because not being able to see makes you feel vulnerable and you don’t know how real the figure at the end of your bed is. You are also afraid to open your eyes, however, as you don’t want to see these awful things that lurk and loom in the darkness. The figure at the end of your bed has eyes too big for his face and he’s looking right at you. Again, emotion overcomes logic and you pull the blanket over your head, hoping you’ll fall asleep soon and the things you see will melt away.

Nights like these, your dreams are sharp and painful. You hear whispers and snickers in the distance and you know someone you love is saying awful things about you. They have assured you many times before that they would never say such things, but you are forced to hear jabbing remarks made over and over again in a voice that could not belong to anyone but them. You begin to feel sick and there is a horribly sharp pain in your lower back that makes you feel like you cannot move more than a fraction of an inch at a time. Unsure of what else to do, you begin to run. 

You are outside, but the world around you is too dark to give off any hints of your location. No matter where you look, you cannot find any other people. The insults from before are still ringing in your ears, but are now accompanied by a rapidly thumping dread. Someone is looking for you as you run through the dark. You can feel beads of sweat running down the back of your neck and your breathing is heavy enough to get you caught by whoever is close in pursuit. You find yourself crouched behind the wide, twisting trunk of an old tree, tears streaming down your face as your try to get your heart to quiet down. They are close now. You do not know who they are and again you have gotten to the point in the dream where you have long forgotten that this is all in your head. The game is real now, and you are losing at an alarming rate.

Only one thought swells up and occupies your mind now: _I am so alone._

You are only partially correct.

Blinking through tears, you see a pair of shoes and someone’s legs. You are too scared to look up at who is towering over you, and you freeze up in shock. As they move closer, the sharp sensation in your back doubles, causing you to fall to the ground, twisting in pain. You close your eyes once more. It is not dark behind your eyelids, but instead various waves of black and blue and purple. You find that you are unable to open your eyes, but you hear a voice that you assume must belong to the person who is standing above you.

_Do you know where you go next?_ they ask you in an eerily calm and hauntingly familiar voice. You do not understand what they mean.

_Ah. You do not. I suppose that gives me the task of bringing you the bad news._

One more jolt of pain shakes you awake. For a moment, you are not sure what just happened or if you are able to breathe. Maybe this is the bad news that the person who found you had referred to. You are now awake, nothing to hide you from the grasp of some dark figure besides the rough texture of the ceiling and a vague memory of running. You are still out of breath.
