Last week was National French Week and campus was bustling with programs in-person and online for all to partake in the immersion of French language and culture. It was also the beginning of International Education Week (Nov. 15 - 19), which led to the inclusion of a plethora of other cultures being represented throughout the week. Among the student organizations hosting were Entre Nous and the International Student Program.

On Friday, Nov. 6, a French film, “Elle S’en Va,” was shown in Edson Auditorium at 7 p.m. to kick off the incoming week of celebrations. 

On Tuesday, Nov. 10, Entre Nous hosted their annual Tour de Morris mini bike race on the Mall. The event, which began at 11:40 a.m., featured students riding mini bikes (socially distanced) through an amusing course. Bikes were sanitized between riders.

Later that day, the International Student Program held the annual International Language Circle Virtual Event as part of International Education & National French Week. The event took place via Zoom and ran from 8 p.m. to approximately 9 p.m. Participants were invited to teach a fun, five minute lesson on their chosen language. 

Leslie Gubash-Lindberg taught us some Arabic, specifically some fun colloquial sayings in Lebanese Arabic. Interestingly enough, Arabic is the fourth most commonly used language in the world (after Mandarin, Spanish, and English). We learned sayings of hospitality, such as “sahtein” ( meaning two healths, akin to “bon appetit”). We also learned sayings related to the eye, such as “tekram aaynak” ( meaning to the dignity of your eye, or “whatever you desire”). At the end of the presentation, we were rewarded with some amusing insults relating to the foot, such as “ijri fik” ( meaning my foot in you, in other words “I will kick your arse”). 

Elmurad Abbasov taught us some Azerbaijani, as well as some Russian. While Azerbaijani has many similar words from Turkish, as well as Arabic, Russian has many similarities with Ukranian, Czech, Polish, and Slovak. Russian has a very different structure from the English language, with word placement in a sentence being left to the discretion of the speaker. For example, “I was going home today” and “I going home was today” would both be grammatically correct in Russian.

Bailey Borowick taught us some French, which was quite fitting, considering French is the only language other than English that is taught in every country in the world. In fact, the number of French speakers has tripled since 1945, an impressive feat. We learned “bonsoir” and “bonne nuit,” which mean “good evening” and “good night”, respectively. We also learned some helpful phrases when meeting people, such as “comme allez-vous,” which means “how are you doing,” and “quelle heure est-il,” which means “what time is it.” We were also educated on how to describe yourself in French by using the correct sentence structure and various vocabulary words. 

Signy Mastel taught us about Norway, one of the happiest countries in the world, as well as some phrases for basic conversation. Surprisingly enough, the word for “hi” was “hei,” pronounced quite similarly. Unsurprisingly, most of the Norwegian language is not reflected as English cognates. With “snakker du norsk” meaning “do you speak Norwegian” and “varsågod” meaning “you’re welcome,” we had much to learn, and many laughs as Signy educated us on the various Norewgian myths and folktales. 

There were many other languages presented, such as Mandarin, Nepali, German, and Spanish. The language circle was an amazing opportunity to learn about different cultures and languages from the comfort of our own homes, staying safe and smiling through our screens with students and faculty alike.

On Wednesday, Nov. 11, the Academic Center for Enrichment hosted Pounce Around the World in HFA 45, as well as broadcasted via Zoom. The event began at 6 p.m. and featured various activities from different cultures, as well as the Morris Book of Local Records Competition and Awards, highlighting the various accomplishments of students and testing some with their knowledge, as well as their might. There was a student panel prior to the competition, and students learned about the unique experiences that their peers had in March of 2020, when study abroad sessions were cut short or cancelled completely. We are truly living in unprecedented times.

On Thursday, Nov.12, hosted the annual Cabaret, featuring acts and interactive experiences from cultures across the globe. Cabaret took place in Edson Auditorium and was also broadcasted via Zoom. There were songs sung and a rousing game of FIFA, as well as beautiful poems read in English, French, and Ojibwe. 

There were also some delicious new additions to the dining hall menu, as Native American, Vietnamese, and Senegalese cuisine was featured, with one new dish each day. With travel restrictions being imposed this year, the International Education Week was especially heartwarming. While we were unable to host every typical event this semester, we made the best of it, creating yet another fall of unforgettable memories.
