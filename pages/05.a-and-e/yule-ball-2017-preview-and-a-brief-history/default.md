Yasamin Graff and Emily Johnson of the Yule Ball committee were gracious to answer my questions about the upcoming Yule Ball celebration on Saturday, December 9 from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. (admission $2). They gave me not only a good preview of what is to come, but a bit about the eight year history of the ball. 

1) What student orgs will be present?
Chemistry Club will portray Slug Club and make potions, Bio Club will have pictures with the snake, Mock Trial is making wands, History Club is hosting a Harry Potter History Museum, and an Orchestra quartet will be playing for the first hour in the TMC. 

2) What activities are planned this year?
Improv Club will dress up as Hogwarts professors and sort students into houses. We'll play _Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them_ in Moccasin Flower Room.

3) How long has Yule Ball been going on? Can you tell me anything about the history of it?
This is the 8th annual Yule Ball. It was started by the Ground Quidditch Executives as a way to celebrate the release of _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1_. 

4) Do you or anyone else involved in Yule Ball have any memories about it that you would like to share?
"When Eric Dymit (Professor Quirrell) ran into the sorting ceremony last year and yelled, 'TROLL IN THE DUNGEON'" - Katie McCreary. 
"Pretending to know what I was doing when we were waltzing" - Brenna Rubendall and Amelia Nelson
"Counting how many people asked if the Deathly Hallows symbol was the Illuminati" - Emily Johnson 

5) Can people still sign up to volunteer for it? What help is needed?
People can still volunteer. PLEASE. We need people. You can take tickets, watch food, or watch the doors for an hour (or more,) and you'll get into the dance for free! Email graff157@morris.umn.edu to sign up.
