On Friday, Aug. 21, the Flappers Comedy Club hosted their 7th annual international Burbank Comedy Festival, lovingly renamed the Burbank Covedy Festival, over Zoom. The event was free to all UMM students. The show began at 7 p.m. and ran until 8 p.m. It opened with Noah Copfer, the host for the evening’s show. He began with some interesting bits about his irrational fear of birds and left us all with a little taste of the hilarious comedy that was about to come. There were seven acts that night, each with a hilarious twist on the COVID-19 crisis, all the while the comedians weaved their own personality into the mix. The show was actually pretty entertaining for being over Zoom. I sat down with comedians Samuel Morrison and Anthony Zuccaro to get a better picture of how it is to be a comedian during these times. 

Morrison started our interview straight and to the point. When asked to describe his set, he simply said, “I fuck a lot of dads.” He mainly pokes fun at age-playing, occasionally changing that up. Morrison got in to stand-up during his freshman year in college. He started out in an open mic, completely alone, and ended up being well supported. The reason? “Impulse.” Morrison heard about the virtual festival and said he just “went for it.” 

Zuccaro started out similarly, with a talent show in high school when he was 17. It was the end of his senior year. He said, “I was incredibly nervous and I actually did alright.” With regards as to why he has continued the craft, he said, “It’s just been an addiction ever since then. I started stand-up as a way to process the world.” 
He was drawn to the festival since he preferred a cozy way to get his thoughts out. “I use humor to work through stuff. That, and iced coffee...about three a day,” he said.

When describing his set, he did not hesitate with this response. 

“Observational and angry. I observe things to me that don’t make sense and kind of get upset when they don’t make sense.” 

Zuccaro felt that the festival was run well, considering the sudden switch to remote shows. “So many things can go wrong, there could be delays, but they did so well converting us over to the Zoom shows,” Zuccaro said. “I had standard nerves but I also had the nerves of the last time I did standup on March 10. This was the longest I had ever gone without stand-up before. What really helped is to be able to have new jokes. I was able to have bullet points up and I feel that the flow of my jokes was a bit better.”

Morrison seemed to be a bit melancholy about the at-home shows. 

“I mean, I’m a lot more comfortable throwing out premises over Zoom,” he said, “but it’s kind of sad, at least from a performer’s perspective.” He went into more detail, mentioning the delays in audience reactions and the awkward lags in a stream.

Zuccaro had a different opinion of Zoom versus live shows. 

“There are two main differences between live and Zoom. The immediacy of audience participation is different. If you’re watching by yourself, you won’t be laughing as much by yourself. Laughter is a group thing, you know. With live shows, you get the community of people in the audience laughing together, and you are comforted by anonymity. The other thing that comes along with that is I stop talking when I hear laughter. At one of my sets, my set became a long monologue. Some comedians might struggle with this. For example, one comedian said a joke and it didn’t go over, and she assumed there was a problem with the audio. The tragedy of comedy going bad translates to Zoom. I’m grateful for everyone that tuned in. I like when people tune in with five people on one screen.”

In the end, we all agreed that there is an irreplaceable joy in seeing a live performance, but that being said, laughter is the best medicine.

When asked how people should get into stand-up, Zuccaro suggested going with your gut. “I think everyone, no matter who you are, should try stand-up at least once, or try taking at least one improv class. You never know if you're gonna try stand-up once and realize, ‘oh, I’m gonna do this.’”

For anyone who is looking to start out, even in a Zoom show with a few friends, Morrison advises people to just go for it. “I honestly don’t think there’s anything special about me or any performer. I think it’s simply practiced. I know it sounds crazy but I think it’s like playing the piano or riding a bike. Everyone is absolute shit when they start and you get better by doing it more over time. I think that takes some of the mystique of it, some of the ‘maybe I don’t have the right personality, maybe I don’t have the right skillset,” because you don’t have those things when you first start, so you don’t have to worry about it. You suck and you get to fail for a couple years. It’s almost like an opportunity. I get to be bad and have creative freedom, and no one is expecting anything of me. Unfortunately, the only way you can learn how to do standup or be a personality is just by doing it. There’s nothing else to it.”

The burbank Flappers club will be doing more Zoom shows, and they reached out to everyone who participated in the event to send availability. To find tickets, follow Zuccaro at @Anthonyzuccaro on Instagram and Twitter. On both of those, there will be links to his newsletter, Sometimes Weekly. On there, he writes longer pieces that don’t really work for standup, as they are mainly for history.

You can follow Morrison on Instagram or Twitter, with the handle @Samuelhmorrison. He also has a website, http://www.samuelmorrison.com, with an automated emailing system that will notify you of any updates on his upcoming shows, as well as links to tickets.
