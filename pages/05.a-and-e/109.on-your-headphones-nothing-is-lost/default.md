Last issue, I opened the academic year with Grimes’ _Miss Anthropocene_, an album about mystery and the imminent destruction of humanity. This issue, I am attempting to bring some solace to my lovely readers. Where there is darkness, there is always a sliver of light shining through the dark cloud of chaos and calamity. That light, this week, is Luca Fogale’s _Nothing is Lost._ 

A western-Canada based, British-Columbian musician, Luca Fogale has released his sophomore album this past week, and in perfect timing with the current state of the world. Although the folk/indie genre is not my favorite, I will give every album a chance to prove me wrong. Two tracks in, Fogale instantly proved me wrong. 

Elizabeth Collins, a publicist for The Syndicate, goes on to describe the same silky, smooth voice that entranced me into putting this lovely album on loop: 
    “The honesty in Fogale’s voice is impossible to ignore, elevating songs rooted in the folk tradition to soulful hymns about the 
    human condition. Beneath the calm and melancholic tones of his music is a fervent desire to pull the listener as far into his 
    lyrics and chords as possible until all else fades into the background. _Nothing is Lost_ is about holding on to the idea that 
    everything is cyclical and infinite, giving us an opportunity to overcome anything with enough hope and patience.”
   
Take one look at the cover art for _Nothing is Lost_ and you will understand the aura that this artist is striving to create. A simple side profile with a slight blur, with nowhere for the viewer to focus but Fogale. He is vulnerable, he is out in the open, and he is trusting us with his craft. The black background is soothing, with no details or added images to distract you from the dear friend calling out to us. “‘Cause if nothing is sacred//Then nothing is lost//And I’m in your corner//Whatever the cost.” Those lines, from “Another Way Around”, amplify the voices of so many people. These are unprecedented times, and we are all social creatures who cling to communication and company. The Syndicate has the inside scoop on Fogale’s aim with releasing this album.
 
“With this album, Fogale wanted to scratch the surface of what it means to be alive, and what it means to believe in 
 something. Discussing, he states, ‘I feel as though the questions about existence inside these songs are questions that most 
people ask themselves. So many of us are desperately trying to figure how to find purpose, with or without spirituality. There 
is a real beauty in being connected by that.’”

Listen to _Nothing is Lost_, and let the relaxing indie vibes wash over you. Pick a quiet afternoon, lay on your back, turn on the fan, and just close your eyes. His music is clean, with no heavy bass or complicated guitar to take away from the beauty of his message. As was previously stated, Fogale is out in the open, with outstretched arms, ready to welcome us into his safe haven. This is what we need to do as a community: we need to open our hearts and be vulnerable with one another. Showing weakness can speed up progress, this has been proven throughout history.
Before I go on a tangent about comradery, I would like to close this article with lyrics from “Every Colour.” Amidst the soft piano and the delicate instrumental, come these words:
 
“Oh, I feel the hours slipping//While I stumble to the edge//Losing faith in everything//When I couldn’t make a dent.//‘Cause I seem to forget//When I get all worked up//That you can find every colour//If you look close enough.”
