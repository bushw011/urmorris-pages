On Thursday, Nov. 5, Dr. Ann DuHamel, assistant professor in the Music Discipline, held a seminar as part of the Thursday Afternoon Faculty Series, focusing on Beethoven’s last three piano sonatas (namely Opus 109, 110, and 111). The event took place in the Recital Hall with an opening reception at 4:30 p.m. DuHamel defines transcendence as something relating to a spiritual, or non-physical realm. Now, some musical qualities specific to late Beethoven piano works signified such a feeling. 

One such quality is a heightened sense of musical time and space, with expansion of motivic material. In the first movement of Opus 109, this exposition takes seven seconds to perform. This is strikingly different from most of Beethoven’s earlier works. In the music that Beethoven is writing at this time, there is less transitional material than what was expected by those at the time – possessing more of a “rhapsodic” quality, as DuHamel so eloquently put it.

Another quality is creating a “special sound-world,” such as using extended trills. These appear in Opus 109, third movement, as well as Opus 111, second movement. Along with the trills in Opus 111, there are extremes of register used to instill deeper emotions. This trill seemed to add an air of lyricism to Beethoven’s sonatas. 

Yet another quality of Beethoven’s “transcendental” sonatas is thwarting the expectations of the listener. This is the idea of innovating forms, having the audience second-guess themselves with where one movement ends and another movement begins. He also experimented with hybrid forms. For example, Opus 111 uses both sonata-allegro and fugal forms. 

Many scholars have marveled at Beethoven’s works, with Andras Schiff exclaiming, “The last three sonatas are so great that words fail.”

Beethoven’s Opus 111 in C minor has two movements: The first being a maestoso that starts with a slow introduction full of diminished seventh chords, a tribute to French baroque music, and the second being an arietta that (contrastingly) sounds very futuristic, compared to what is being written at the time. There is great depth in the simplicity of this Opus.

After going in great depth with Beethoven’s last three piano sonatas, DuHamel played the lovely second  movement  of Opus 111. Such grace, such definition in each individual sound permeating the very air around the piano. The sudden gusto that encompasses the room when a strong chord is laid down, the clever juxtaposition alone could take your breath away. She tells the audience about the technical challenges in learning late Beethoven sonatas, as well as how having more experience in life facilitated her growing appreciation for Beethoven’s late sonatas.
