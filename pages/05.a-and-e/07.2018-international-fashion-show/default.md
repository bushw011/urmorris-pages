As part of International Education Week, the University of Minnesota Morris held the International Fashion Show that is hosted by United Students for Africa (USA) on Thursday, November 8 at 7:00 p.m in the Student Center’s Oyate Hall. The annual event continuously strives to nurture the community in raising awareness of the diversity here at UMM through an array of traditional clothing, music and performances. This year, the show had Fatou Jarjou as its MC with Hannah Sajulga and Ahnaf Yasin opening with an acoustic rendition of Stevie Wonder’s classic hit “Isn’t She Lovely.”

The pieces that were modeled are inspired by different cultures all over the world from West Africa, Southeast Asia, Northern Europe, and more. Some of the clothing had been customly made for those who participated in the fashion show. A number even wore pieces that were handmade by family members. To gain better insight from being an audience member viewing the assorted garments that were shown on stage, I was able to catch up with a few of the models from the event and ask them about their own experience.

“I wore two outfits for the fashion show, one being from Myanmar that was matched with a purple sarong along with a green top. The other outfit is a traditional Karen dress that was made by my aunt back in Thailand. It was handwoven with mainly pink and white fabrics and some blue flower patterns were added. The Karen people are an ethnic group primarily living in Myanmar and Thailand. Because of the civil war that is going on, Karen people had fled all over the world. Some of us live in Canada, Norway, Australia, North Korea, to name a few. Being in the fashion show was a good experience overall. Every participant had been really nice and made me feel inclusive. I was nervous at first but with my friends also being a part of it, I became more comfortable in every rehearsal. I would definitely encourage people to participate in the International Fashion Show. Even if you don't have traditional clothing, there are clothes that USA has for you to model.”

“The red-orange outfit that I wore was a traditional Navajo rug dress styled with a sash belt and a turquoise jewelry set. The white blouse and three-tiered floral print skirt was also a traditional Navajo dress paired with some turquoise jewelry. Both of my outfits were actually made by my mom. She’s so talented. I’m surprised at how she made them in such short notice.”

“So for the fashion show, we had three practices. The first one was where participants picked and choose what to wear then the next two was where we actually practiced walking the runway. The piece that I wore this year was personally tailored for me. It’s a sea and tanned colored tight-fitting dress with pearls. It’s Gambian inspired usually worn at bridal showers. I think everyone enjoyed themselves and the outfits that were presented depicted a lot of different cultures that aren’t really represented everyday around here.”

“[The fashion show] was overall an exciting experience for me. It was interesting to see people represent various countries by modeling their traditional clothing. I think it’s important to respect and be able to appreciate people of different backgrounds and their culture so it was humbling for me to model traditional African pieces.”

“I joined USA among various other clubs and activities hoping to reconnect with the cultural aspect of my life. I was born in Ibadan, Nigeria. I value being a Nigerian to the highest degree, so when the opportunity came to represent my country, I was more than happy to take it. I even asked my mom if I could bring some of my traditional beads from home to wear for the fashion show. My first outfit was made in Nigeria, while my second outfit that I wore with my friend Hoomz was donated to USA. It was really nice seeing different clothing from other cultures as well. When we all stood on the stage for the final moment, I felt like the nations were united.”
