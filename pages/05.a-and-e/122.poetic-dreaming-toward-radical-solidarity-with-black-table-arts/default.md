title: 'Poetic Dreaming Toward Radical Solidarity with Black Table Arts'

On Wednesday, Jan. 27, Elizabeth (Liz) Thomson from EDI hosted a poetry workshop over Zoom to celebrate Dr./Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The workshop was available over Zoom, and was open to all, provided they RSVP via email. The event ran from 7-8 p.m. Attendees were able to interact with the guest speaker, Keno Evol, and unmute their mics in order to converse with one another during the course of the hour long workshop. 

Evol is a poet, scholar, and educator based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He oversees Black Table Arts, a community-driven arts cooperative. He also edited “A Garden Of Black Joy: Global Poetry From The Edges of Liberation And Living,”  and has received numerous grants and fellowships for his work, namely the 2017 Sonia Sanchez-Langston Hughes Poetry Contest. 

Evol started the program by playing a clip of the late Vincent Harding speaking to young people:
 “Harding had a lot to say about young people. A lot to say about poetics, a lot to say about the movement from below, that sort of required to keep enthusiasm in this beloved community.”

Participants were then instructed to jot down anything about the contents of the audio clip that stuck out to them, whether it was a particular word or phrase, or simply Harding’s cadence that reminded them of something in their personal lives.

Personally, this quote stuck out to me.

 “I am a citizen of a country that does not yet exist. That’s who I see you all as being, especially you younger folks, but not confined to you younger folks. We are citizens of a country that we still have to create…”

Harding passed in 2014, but before he passed, he left behind many memorable works written about Martin Luther King Jr., who he knew personally.

We had a thorough discussion about the audio recording, and participants reflected on how our current society paralleled his words on how we need to consistently strive for change, even when everyday society is inclined to live in a stagnant world of ignorance and violent crime.

We were then introduced to a couple of pieces by Nate Marshall.

The Valley of its Making

poetry makes nothing happen
—W. H. Auden

the people in the streets
are plucked up like
radishes from dark earth,
heads beat the purplish-red
of ripeness. the women lead
the stupid & brutish to a
future they don’t deserve.
the organized are still
unbearably human, they
still fuck & hurt & harm
& are not actually sorry.
the people still fight
each other too much &
the system not enough
& too often it is not a fight
but a bullet. too many men
want to be in the front
& don’t want to march
anywhere in particular.
some of us have degrees
& noses to look down. 
so many want a version
of old days that never
existed. many are still unwilling
to grow a vocabulary for personhood,
even from the words already in them.
so many will deny they to a sibling
simply because. our people are
messy & messed up & a mess.
nothing about our people is romantic
& it shouldn’t be. our people deserve
poetry without meter. we deserve our
own jagged rhythm & our own uneven
walk toward sun. you make happening happen.
we happen to love. this is our greatest
action. 

Picking Flowers
By Nate Marshall

Grandma’s rosebush
reminiscent of a Vice Lord’s do-rag.
the unfamiliar bloom in Mrs. Bradley’s yard
banging a Gangster Disciple style blue.
the dandelions all over the park putting on
Latin King gold like the Chicano cats
over east before they turn into a puff
of smoke like all us colored boys.

picking dandelions will ruin your hands,
turn their smell into a bitter cologne.

a man carries flowers for 3 reasons:

                       • he is in love
                       • he is in mourning
                       • he is a flower salesman

i’m on the express train passing stops
to a woman. maybe she’s home.
i have a bouquet in my hand,
laid on 1 of my arms like a shotgun.

After discussing, Evol asked attendees to reflect on the last time we did something meaningful with others, and gave us time to write a quick poem about our experience. Shortly after, participants went around and shared their thoughts, before closing the event with kind remarks by Evol and Thomson.
Keep an eye out for more EDI events, and please RSVP beforehand.
