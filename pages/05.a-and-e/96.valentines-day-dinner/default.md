February 14 was a day filled with love, and for the Concert Choir, it was an evening of generosity. At 6 p.m., the doors of Oyate opened and the room was transformed into a lovely banquet hall. With warm jazz and romantic, candlelit tables, the atmosphere was set for the choir’s annual Valentine’s Day Dinner.

Cost to attend was $18, and the event was sold out, with every chair reserved in advance. This year, all of the night’s proceeds went directly toward funding the upcoming study abroad. The menu featured beef tenderloin with aju sauce or stuffed pepper, chifles (fried plantains), vegetable quinoa pilaf, and chocolate fudge cake, as well as a wine bar available until 7:30 p.m.

The event had minimal decorations, with the music draping a grandiose veil over the room. The entertainment started at 7:15 p.m, with performers dressed to the tee, not a hair out of place.

The first act was Melanie Madson’s rendition of Cole Porter’s “So in Love (Kiss Me Kate),” accompanied by members of the jazz combo. Melanie’s warm, well-rounded voice – accompanied by a gentle instrumental – opened the evening with a lovely note.

The second act was Jeff Langman’s original, “Coming Over Today.” A wholesome, giddy, and simple song, this tune was written and sung for his fiancé.

The third act was Katie Booth and Justin Martin’s duo performing “Only Us” from “Dear Evan Hansen,” with piano accompaniment. Their performance was emotional, 
and told a genuine story between the lyrics.

The fourth act was an a capella performance by Tonal Eclipse, a student=run vocal jazz group co-led by Johannah Woodley. The group sang Linda Kachelmeier’s “We Toast the Days,” which was a soft, soulful, and heartwarming piece. Traditionally sung for New Year’s celebrations, I found it fitting to sing the tune on a night of new beginnings for the choir, for the upcoming trip, and for Tonal Eclipse.

The fifth act was a solo by Johannah Woodley, performing Livingston & Evans “Never Let Me Go,” accompanied by the jazz combo. When asked about performing for the fundraiser, she told me: “This was the largest audience that I have performed a jazz solo for. I have done events like this in high school. I was part of a jazz cabaret, where I worked with a professional rhythm section and sang similarly to what I sang tonight. I have not sung since my time in high school, and it felt nice to be doing it again.”

The sixth act was another a capella, this time a barbershop quartet known on campus as the Fortissimo Fellas. Huy Tran, a sophomore Vocal Music Education major, was able to give us some insight into the origin of the group.

“The Fortissimo Fellas are a group of pals who just love to get together and sing and entertain people! The group was founded three years ago by four alumni. The 
bonds within the group are really special. We are all a part of the Concert Choir, and that in itself is already such a unique bond between people! We also have a group-chat with all of the previous and current members of the quartet where we just chat, and current members will often send videos of their most recent performances. They’re a really great group of guys.”

The Fortissimo Fellas sang “Follow Me” by Matthew Schafer, also known as Uncle Kracker. The audience enjoyed the sweet quartet, particularly their pre-song jokes and jabs about romance. Best of luck to the Fortissimo Fella still looking for his Valentine – you’ll find one soon!

The seventh act was Emily Kjenass performing Harnick & Bock’s “Vanilla Ice Cream” from the musical, “She Loves Me.” An interesting choice, this act had a familiar air to the Fortissimo Fellas, full of good fun. From joking to genuine love and compassion, this song took so many turns and twists – surely, a crowd favorite.

Before the last act, choir director Bradley Miller took a moment to recognize the nature of the fundraiser, as well as the exciting opportunities that students would have  on their upcoming trip. 

“In March of 2020, the University of Minnesota Morris Concert Choir will embark on a nine-day international performance tour through Peru. We hope to raise $3,000 to award directly to student participants on the tour. The choir is thrilled to serve as ambassadors of the University of Minnesota Morris and our members are grateful for any support you are able to provide. This experience will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many members. The choir will perform full concerts in several historic venues in both Lima and Cusco, participate in an exchange concert with a choir from the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, and present a public service concert at an orphanage in the Sacred Valley. In addition to performing, they will take part in many enriching excursions to museums and archaeological sites, including Machu Picchu. By immersing themselves in another country’s history, art, and culture, students will gain new insight about much of the music we perform.”

The eighth act featured Concert Choir. The choir surrounded the ballroom, filling each and every inch of the room with sound as they performed two songs: Jeff Langman’s “If You Told Me” and Felipe Coronel Rueda’s “Estrellita del sur.” The last song, which will be performed on their study abroad, is a Peruvian waltz.

Concert Choir will be performing their send-off concert for Peru on March 7. If anyone is interested in sending donations to the choir, you can visit http://c-fund.us/pl9 to make a donation.
