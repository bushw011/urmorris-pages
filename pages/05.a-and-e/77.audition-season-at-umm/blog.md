**By Geordi Jones, A&E Editor** _Originally published in Issue 1, Volume 32 of The University Register on Friday, September 13, 2019_

Minnesota Fringe Festival, a central hub for experimental and up-and-coming theatre in the state, was held August 1 through 11. Many playwrights had the chance to debut their own original works, including Paige Quinlivan, a recent graduate of the University of Minnesota Morris (UMM).

Quinlivan, who graduated in May of 2019, wrote her play "Moon River" as part of her senior project while a student at UMM. The Fringe production had many UMM alumni in the cast and crew.

Maggie Caplan directed the production, with music composed by Claire McManus, both of whom are also 2019 graduates. The production starred Katie Rowles-Perich, ‘18, and Bailey Soika, ‘19. Also featured in the cast were Charliey Libra, Colton Moyer, Nora Sonneborn, and Jack Squier. The blurb from the show’s playbill reads: “In 1944, the moon disappeared from the sky. 16 years later, a greaser and a square are drawn together by fate in an homage to butch/feminine identity that queers the fraught legacy of contemporary fantasy.” The production was shown at the Ritz Theatre Studio in Minneapolis five times over the course of Minnesota Fringe between August 1-11.
