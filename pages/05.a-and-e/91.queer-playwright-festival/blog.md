On Sunday, November 25, Meiningens Student Theatre and QUEST hosted the first Queer Playwright Festival in the TMC. While the performances were held at 7:30 p.m., students were working from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m., reading scenes, learning blocking, and putting it all together.

The eight student-directed performances were all scenes from plays written by queer playwrights. According to Chelsea Young, who helped put on the festival: “It brought a subject that is not often discussed into the light. This particular event was a way to pay homage to the successful queer individuals that paved the way for groups like Quest and Meiningens Student Theatre to be able to explore LGBTQ+ themes with such freedom and depth. I believe it is always important to reflect upon where we have been in order to grow into where we are going, so as the creator of Quest it was important to me to give a message to students and allow them to see what great things they could accomplish regardless of the descrimination they may face. The theatre has not always been as inclusive as it is today, but to be able to see how far things have come and to be able to enjoy the creations done by such prominent playwrights was a treat for all students alike.”

Young introduced each scene by giving a description of the play, telling the audience who it was written by, who was acting in it, and who directed it. Performances included scenes from “Our Town” by Thornton Wilder, “Angels in America” by Tony Kushner, “Next Fall” by Geoffrey Nauffts, “Christina, the Girl King” by Michel Marc Bouchard, “The Baltimore Waltz” by Paula Vogel, “The Importance of Being Earnest” by Oscar Wilde, “Gross Indecency: The Three Trials” of Oscar Wilde by Moisés Kaufman, and “A Late Snow” by Jane Chambers. The scenes were around 10 minutes long and ranged in topics– from young love in a small town to being put on trial. The festival was a successful one and something that the group hopes to continue to put on in the future.
