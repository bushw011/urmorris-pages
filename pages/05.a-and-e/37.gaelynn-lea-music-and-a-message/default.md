On February 23 in Edson auditorium, Gaelynn Lea gave an audience an unforgettable performance, showing how simple, yet intricate, some songs can be. Simple notes and chords, wrapping and looping around one another to create a haunting and innovative sound. Accompanied by guitar and a voice that echoes in a room, Lea has created an environment of inclusivity and hope for audiences. 

Accompanied by a guitarist Dave Mehling, Lea began the concert with her tune “Someday We’ll Linger in the Sun.” This was a winning selection in NPR’s Tiny Desk Contest which consists of competition of over 6,000 musicians across the country. Beginning by playing a single note on her violin, Lea conveyed a pure and raw tone. Over time, countless other melodies were added in by Lea’s looping system. Sliding up and down the bridge of the violin, she showed the audience how tone and the simplicity of a tune can affect sound. 

Yet, the process in which Lea performs is anything but simple. She holds the violin like a cello, moving the bow below her chest. She holds the bow like a baseball bat so it is better to grip. Near her feet sits her loop station, where she controls the different melodies and sounds that overlap during her songs. When she has mastered the sounds and everything seems to be in place, she starts to sing, moving her whole body with the rhythm of the tune. 

One memorable song was “All Changing Tides,” which began with aerial sounds of the sky and steady marimba-like notes conveying the mood. Lea’s falsetto was featured, floating with weightlessness and innocence. Yet, as the song continued, Lea’s lower register was more prominent. She produced a raw and gripping sound that suited the climax of the piece. 

When explaining her goals as an artist, Lea said that it is crucial to represent disabilities in a positive light. Often people will depict disabled individuals as “suffering” or “challenged” and she hopes to represent them for their achievements. Music has allowed her to become a champion for disability rights. 

Continuing the concert, Lea incorporated audience participation into one of her songs. In “The Bird Song,” she taught the crowd a simple melody by the lyrics of “Bird, why do you sing? Fate has clipped your wings.” As she began to play and organized the different sounds, the audience sang. Adding another layer of melody, Lea sang a bright and quick jig; her voice essentially was bouncing note by note, up and down chromatically. 

What charmed many was Lea’s sense of humor. Before each song, she made sure to make a side joke to the guitarist. While they both chuckled, people in the crowd raised eyebrows in confusion. In one instance where Lea couldn’t help but stifle a smile during the song, she remarked afterwards that “it’s really hard to cough when you’re in that really delicate part in a song.” 

Ending the concert with a standing ovation and an encore, Lea showed the crowd how disability doesn’t have to surround a person’s accomplishments. Rather than being an inhibitor, disability elevates Lea, which ultimately encourages others to have a positive sense of identity.
