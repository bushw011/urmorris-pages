Auditions for this year’s children’s show, _Step on a Crack_, are just around the corner. For Director Siobhan Bremer, Associate Professor of Theatre Arts, children’s theater is an expertise. Since the age of four, Bremer has acted in countless children’s theater productions and has recently directed several at UMM. The spring show, _Step on a Crack_, follows Ellie, a girl whose father has just remarried. Ellie, disapproving of her stepmother, plays in her imaginary world to escape real-world problems. 

What is the overall premise of the show and some important themes within it?
BREMER: The thing that I like about it is that it’s a mix of fantasy and realism. A lot of the shows that I’ve done here at UMM have been more fantasy based. It’s an opportunity for students to use their realistic acting training from classes and additionally these fantasy and animated acting techniques. Children’s theater is different from a typical show because it demands in energy and animation. With themes, the show is about acceptance and finding the positive in life’s situations. What the main character goes through is unfortunate, but she has to move on. She escapes her frustration and upset by going into her imaginary world, but in the end, she must face the real world. 

Why does UMM do a children’s show?
BREMER: It's a good service and outreach. The style of the show is more accepting for people with less theater experience, so we encourage anyone on campus to audition, theater major or not. It has serious voice, body, and energy demands, and it is a serious time commitment. Rehearsals run Monday through Friday evenings  often from 6:30-8:30 or 9 p.m. The week and a half of performances is intense because students in the show miss class to perform for [visiting] school kids.

Who comes to the show?
BREMER: We bus in neighboring schools from about a one hour radius of Morris. The exciting thing about _Step on a Crack_ is that it will appeal more to upper-elementary and younger middle-school students because of its subject material. To me, the idea of bringing in kids is exciting because it may be their first exposure to theater. 

What are auditions like for a children’s show? Is it a different environment than any other shows?
BREMER: During auditions, I’m looking for creativeness and inventiveness. For the _Step on a Crack_ audition, individuals can come with a very short scene prepared. The ideal time length would be 30-40 seconds. It’s also important that individuals will come in something that they can move in because some of the characters in the show perform stunts. We want to see if people can do cartwheels or any fun stunt. We might do playful things like “acting like the floor is lava” or “pretend it’s raining”. The expectation is that individuals will be there at 6:30 p.m. to watch the audition process because half of the audition is showing that you can be a respectful listener for the other auditioners. 

How are you hoping to incorporate stunts into the show?
BREMER: The two imaginary friends: Lana and Frizbee, are both very active characters in the show. Any crazy jumps or cartwheels/tricks will be put in so that the characters can travel across the width of the stage quickly. 

What are you looking forward to most in the show?
BREMER: I love the rehearsal process.The inventing the magic, seeing what students can come up with. I have a vision in my head right now of the production and it’s always nerve racking and exciting to try to get that vision to come to life on stage. I want to really show that contrast between the family. In Ellie’s world, she sees her family as negative, and she eventually accepts it. This movement should bring audiences to have that “ahhh” moment in the show. 



Auditions will be held Monday, February 12, and Tuesday, February 13 from 6:30-9:30 p.m. Callbacks will be held Thursday, February 15th at 6:30 p.m., along with possible additional call backs on Friday, February 16. The daytime public performances are April 13-14, and the invited school performances are April 11-18.
