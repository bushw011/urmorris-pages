On February 25, ENGL 4039: Feminist and Queer Storytelling, LGBTQIA2S+ Programs, and the English Discipline held the first of a series of Zoom conversations with queer poets and artists. The program features a Zoom call with queer poets and artists every week, and the 25th featured Blackberri, an American singer-songwriter and community activist. His music focuses on social issues including civil rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and HIV/AIDS prevention, among others. In 1981 he released Blackberri and Friends: Finally on his own music label, Bea B. Queen. The first National Third World Lesbian and Gay Conference’s theme song was Blackberri’s song “When Will The Ignorance End.” In 2002 Blackberri received a Lifetime Achievement AIDS Hero Award at the San Francisco Candlelight Vigil. He has a new album forthcoming. Blackberri lives in Oakland, CA. 

At the start of the class, Blackberri sang a song for the class. Then, students were invited to ask questions about Blackberri’s background, his art, and his activism. 

**How did you start writing music?**

I started by writing poetry, actually I still write poetry. When I found the guitar and started playing, I was writing queer songs and my friends said: “You gotta be political or you gotta write queer songs, you can’t do both,” and I said, “Yes I can,” and I did. I think because there were no queer songs and I don’t think they saw sexuality as a revolutionary act – people becoming themselves – it shook America a lot.

When the White Knight riots happened in San Fran, I went to perform on the steps of city hall, but I got caught between police and rioters. Mace and broken glass, people throwing rocks...I was clutching my guitar, sneaking away, and leaving with one of my friends who was slashing police car tires. There were 6-8 police cars that were totally destroyed and burned. I remember when I got fed up with being beat up. I just lost it, and I started biting back. 

**What sort of negativity did you experience when you were first performing?**

The pieces I was writing were so beautiful that people just accepted it. When I joined this rock band, I wrote a queer song called “Frenchie” and people rocked so hard. They just danced to it. 

My band got some criticism every now and then. When I was in the band, being out and proud...I was an embarrassment to them. We were in Tucson, I went to the University of Arizona to study voice, and the band had me because I had a good voice. They were all straight but they didn’t care. 

Nowadays, I’ve gone to countries where people don’t understand my lyrics, but they could feel the emotions and that’s the kind of response that I got, that emotional response...wow that made me so happy.

**Did you always know that you wanted to have the jazz/blues genre when you were singing or did that come about after studying voice?**

I always sang, from when I was really young. One of the things I liked to do was I’d hear the voice of singers and I’d mimic their tones. Through that, I developed an ear for music. I would listen to the radio and I’d try to mimic the different songs by playing them on my harmonica. Depending on what the lyrics are, it shifts the genre of the piece. Some genres make the lyrics easier to shift. To me, the music is the lubrication for the lyrics. Depending on my chosen message, I go for genres that make the lyrical content easier to digest. 

**How do queer people live in a system like this?**

Wealth buys armies and I don’t know if there’s ever going to be a really safe place because the rich have a tight hold on everything and right now they’re kind of losing it. You can see it through all of the outlash. Until everybody becomes aware that they are powerful and that everything comes from within and not from without, they are always going to be in control. The real strength is internal, and once you find that, you become the most powerful person on the planet. Our job is to do that and manifest that outward. The division is the thing that keeps us from becoming one. We are all fingers of God. When we unite and come together, we become a fist. An open hand can slap but a fist can punch, and a punch is more powerful than a slap. There’s a saying that nobody wins until everybody wins and that’s absolutely true. 

Everybody has to be brought to the table, you can’t have any empty chairs. The problem with the community is we still have people that think once they have their rights, they do not have to worry about other people’s rights. What I try to do is talk about all of these different struggles because we all need to include people. If you go on and ignore people who are still suffering, that’s very selfish. I’ve always been about inclusivity and bringing people into the bowl and that’s where I’m coming from. There still discrimination in the white gay community with gay minorities, forgetting about people outside of the circle.
