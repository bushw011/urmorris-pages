On the evening of Friday, February 16, UMM Teaching Specialist Simon Tillier performed his faculty recital, _The Clarinetist On The Roof_. Tillier, the conductor of Symphonic Winds, also recently accompanied vocalist and fellow faculty member Ana Miller during her faculty voice recital, _American Beauty_. For his own recital, Tillier, performing on clarinet, was accompanied by Therese Sutula on piano. The program consisted of six pieces, varying in length from a 14-minute sonata to a brief piano solo featuring Sutula. All of the music that Tillier included was written by Jewish composers or was Jewish-inspired.

The first piece of the night was the first, fourth, and fifth movements of _Five Bagatelles_ by Gerald Finzi. Gerald Finzi was an English composer who came from an Italian-Jewish background. _Five Bagatelles_ is his most popular work and its movements, while very different, demonstrate clearly the impressive range of the clarinet. 

_Cyrene_, the second piece performed by Tillier, was composed by Josef Holbrooke to use the saxophone to bring Greek mythology to the minds of the listeners. Tillier explained this stating that “this was originally written for the saxophone, which I thought I would make note of since it sounds equally nice on clarinet.” He was right in saying that this song does sound wonderful on the clarinet. His performance of its slow movement was very expressive and worked well with the piano accompaniment.

For the third piece, Tillier performed _Allemande_, the first movement of a solo piece composed by Bach for the flute. Like the piece before it, _Cyrene_, this was not originally composed for the clarinet. Regardless of what instrument Bach had intended this complicated composition be played with, the intricacies worked out beautifully on clarinet. It was interesting to see the performance of an unaccompanied solo piece, and it was done quite well.

After Tillier performed _Allemande_, he was followed by his accompanist, Sutula. Sutula played Francis Poulenc’s _Novelette in C Major_. As one of Poulenc’s very first piano pieces, it was not very long, lasting only two minutes. While being very short, it was wonderfully delicate, and was a good way to wrap up the first portion of the recital.

Returning from a quick intermission, Tillier and Sutula finished off the evening very powerfully, playing two sonatas. The first, composed by Peter Hope in 2015, had a clear Jewish influence. Peter Hope is a more recent composer and music arranger from England, and was even responsible for the theme music used by _BBC News _from 1969 through the 1980s. 

The second sonata performed, which was another work from composer Francis Poulenc — written about a year before his death in 1963 — was a beautifully bittersweet finish to the evening. Before stating the piece’s title, Tillier jokingly mentioned that all composers seem to write their best works right before their deaths, even those who are not successful. Despite the playful attitude with which he made this comment and the laughter it garnered from the audience, this final sonata was performed very dynamically and showed the more serious side of the piece. Overall, the night included some very beautiful pieces and showed off the talent of both performers and the amazing amounts of effort put into each song.

The money raised from tickets from this recital will be put towards the Morris Symphonic Winds’ trip to Alaska in May of 2018. The UMM Symphonic Wind Band has gone on numerous tours, both within the US and even internationally. In addition, UMM Symphonic Winds have a concert coming up on Sunday, March 4 at 3p.m. in the HFA Recital Hall. Ticket sales for this concert will also be put toward the 2018 Alaska tour.
