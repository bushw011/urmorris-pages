The International Fashion Show hosted by United Students for Africa (USA) took place a couple weeks ago on November 15. It was hosted by four fashionable people: Prince Nwaonicha, Kriss Baye, Ruth Ezeagwula, and Shirley Sato. The show featured many great traditional African, Indian, Native American, and Japanese outfits. To name some countries, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Gambia were represented along with regions and cultures like West Africa, East Africa, Pakistani, Chinese, Arab, Mhong, and Laos. The stage was set in a thrust position, the lights were beamed toward the center of stage and international music played as the models showed off their luxurious wardrobe. The first round of the show displayed a lovely traditional Lehenga dress from India that was white and gold worn by Harshita Kalidindi; a graceful Uzbekistani red and gold dress worn by Esmira Aliyeva; a black Indian suit worn by Ananya Teklu; and a beautiful, traditional West African bouquet blue dress worn by Magbah Lahai, followed by many more gorgeous dresses.
    
The second round came with more traditional style outfits. More Japanese outfits were displayed along with South American, Native American, and African ensembles. A lot of these dresses came with some interesting beadwork. The shoes that were worn in the show were also a cool sight to see. A big round of applause for all the models, Amy Coria, Hibah Hassan, Aliceson Begaye and Qinyang Wang. They wore heels and walked so gracefully, I do not know how they pulled it off.

After round two came one of the greatest rock shows in history and it was performed by the Bengali BoiZzz. These men said they have been “playing rock n roll for 40 years, lookin’ for that one sweetheart to guarantee them a green card.” The Bengali BoiZzz are made up of three teen heartthrobs Ahnaf Yasin, Salvi Alam, and their great singer Jubair Hassan “had nine years of choir practice from one of Bangladesh's most accredited music school.”  Their lineup only included two songs, which were “Aalo” and “Nitol Paye.” Their show fired up the audience and got them ready for the third and final round.

The final round included a more mainstream feel that had a traditional African dance in between. United Students for Africa said that “The final round is usually dedicated to formal wear. In this case, the models were told to wear formal clothing; it did not have to be from any specific culture. This was to show that even though there is traditional wear, it is not necessarily worn every day and fashion in itself is still evolving. This evolution allows people to mix in traditional wear with the modern attire.” They said that the dance in-between was to showcase “a style of music and dance in West Africa called afro-beat/pop. This usually incorporates familiar drum patterns accompanied by rhythmic dancing.” All in all, this show has given me a broader perspective on global fashion and everyone who helped put this show together did a great job!
