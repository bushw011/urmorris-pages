"After performing again, I realize the new album I've been working on isn't ready yet"
 
The infamous musician, Kanye West, has been keeping us all on our toes for months now. The rapper’s ninth album, _Yandhi_, was scheduled to be released on January 29. However, this was not the case, as the album was delayed after a spontaneous performance at the White House and a private luncheon with the President. 
 
Come on, Kanye, why so heartless? The community has been waiting for this album to drop since the beginning of the semester. Hurry up! _Yandhi_ is supposed to feature several quality contributions from Ty Dolla $ign, 6ix9ine and XXXtentacion. These days, it has just become too common for artists to delay their work due to a stunt in their “creative process” but the media demands that a deadline is met. 
 
If anyone, and I mean _anyone_, is trying to “make it big” in the music industry, then they should, at the very least, have a sense of time management, as well as loyalty to their global fanbase. Yes, the hours may vary, but here in the 21st century, every word, text, and Tweet, is heavily monitored, and a celebrity’s word is taken very seriously. So you say it’s coming out in September? Okay, where’s the proof? No samples, no statements, just an empty promise for the media to lap up amidst the sea of other musicians following their producer’s orders. 
 
This popular trend of “taking a break” has been spreading all across the world, with a significantly large factor being YouTube creators. With popular YouTubers saying that they need time away from their work to regain a sense of creativity, it seems that everyone is a similar type of excuse for their own profession.
