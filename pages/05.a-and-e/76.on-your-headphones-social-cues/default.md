Yet again, I have dug deep into my middle-school music days and found a possible album of audial pleasure: “Social Cues,” the newest album by Cage the Elephant. I know, you probably haven’t heard that name in years, but rest assured, this album will take you back. Released on April 19, “Social Cues” is a somber alternative exploring themes of love, betrayal, and...well, the problem is, that’s about it. I thought that their album would have been more exciting to listen to, considering the praise that they had received in 2013 for their third album, “Melophobia.” The alternative rock band that used to tear up the scene has instead taken a step back, producing songs of little weight with simple, low-fi sounds that are mere shadows of their past albums. On the other hand, the album’s songs themselves aren’t too bad on their own. It is the poor organization of the album itself which leaves more to be desired. If you’re into the indie-rock scene, listen to their song “Broken Boy,” or if you’re more into ballads, check out “Love’s The Only Way.” I, however, will not be purchasing their album, due to its poor construction. Maybe the sixth album will combine good music with solid execution.
