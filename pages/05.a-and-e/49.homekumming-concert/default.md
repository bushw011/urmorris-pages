One of the more hip and alternative showcases we see at Morris is the annual HomeKUMMing Concert, presented by KUMM 89.7 FM. As the University’s Performing Arts Center has been recently renovated by the help of generous donors, the HomeKUMMing Concert was the premier event held in this theatre, taking place on Friday night of September 21. Along with three groups from Minneapolis traveling to campus for the show, Morris’ very own Carheart opened with his acoustic guitar and warmed up the audience before our guests rocked out. While covering songs by Sorority Noise to Johnny Cash, Carheart also performed a few of his own originals chords titled,_ I Really Wanna See You (Look Like Shit)_ and_ Hazel_. The first group is an Electronic Rock band called Phoenix Philosophy playing music from their latest album _Nocturnal_, that had their shows in coffee shops of the Twin Cities and the renowned First Avenue venue to be sold out. Kitty Kitty Bang Bang served some “original lady-flavored basement rock” as they presented to Morris their first self-titled EP, shamelessly representing the LGBTQ community in tracks such as _Lez Do It_. The closing performance of the HomeKUMMing Concert was R&B singer, Nick Jordan along with his two dancers who are in no way strangers to the music scene in Minneapolis. Songs from his recent album like _They Don’t Know_ and _Petty_ garnered much attention within the past year, leading to crowd-tight shows in several venues. With high energy and much appreciation for independent artists, thank you KUMM Radio for presenting this show!
