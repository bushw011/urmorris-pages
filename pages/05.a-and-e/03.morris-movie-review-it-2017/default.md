**By Justice Robinson,** _originally published in Issue 1, Volume 30 of The University Register on Friday, September 21, 2017_

The Morris Movie Theater really set the stage for the 2017 movie version of Stephen King’s _IT_. They started the release with giving away 40 red balloons to their first customers. Walking down to your seat at the left bottom corner of the stage was a single red balloon tied down and to really bring it together there was a clown staged over the right emergency exit watching the crowd below.

With _IT_ having been released as a television series in the 90’s, expectations were set high and fans were ready to enjoy a good scare. For those that don’t know though the synopsis of the movie, it is “a group of bullied kids band together when a shapeshifting demon, taking the appearance of clown, begins hunting children” (IMDb). The reviews for the movie are already higher than the 90’s series on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes.

Now some of the questions fans were asking: Is the movie overly scary? Will new CGI technology make the quality better or worse? Will the story line stay the same? How will Bill Skarsgård compare to Tim Curry as Pennywise the Dancing Clown? Will the iconic scenes such as Georgie and the dancing be in the new movie? 

Answering these without giving to much away, I’ll let you know that the movie isn’t all that scary. The rating is definitely up there for some parts (mostly language) but overall I would let a preteen come watch this. The new CGI technology allowed them to make the scenes feel more real but there were a couple scenes where it felt very fake though still enjoyable. The story line was as true as could be that helped retain the nostalgia of the 90s miniseries and book. Bill Skarsgård gave as good as he could for the character Pennywise and had fans feeling the creepy, frightening vibe that Tim Curry gave before. Bravo Skarsgård, you will haunt my clown nightmares for years to come. Lastly, the ionic scenes were just as great as the 90s series. Georgie’s scene just about made me cringe and cry all at the same time, and Pennywise’s dancing scene was just as iconic though the CGI was weak with this one.

The movie in whole had great actors that brought a very personal and heart touching feel to the movie. The CGI didn’t take away from or ruin the movie plot at all. The connection built with the characters throughout the movie made the jump scares, tears, funny, and victorious moments feel that much more personal and satisfying. _IT_ may be the one of the hottest movies of 2017 and definitely worth seeing for yourself.

Justice’s Review: 85%

NOTE: If you stay till the end of the credits you’ll get one more wicked laugh from Pennywise that will leave you looking behind you the whole way home for that single red balloon.
