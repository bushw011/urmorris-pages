On Friday, March 23, The Campus Activities Council brought Flamenco Vivo to the Edson stage for a performance. The six dancers and four musicians performed _Voces del Sur_, a glimpse into the mysterious land of Andalucia, the southern Spanish region known as “the cradle of flamenco.” The area has been a “melting pot” of Arabic, Gypsy, Sephardic Jewish, and Latino influences. The ensemble sought to create a representation of the diverse representation of culture in the Andalucia area, and the greater Hispanic/Latino people. 

The first dance of the night was titled “Mujeres Valientes.” It surrounded two Latin American women, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz and Manuela Saenz and their fight for the defense of women’s rights and individuality. In the first portion of the dance, Cruz displayed a jubilant and free mood in her stage presence. With two nuns overwatching her, she twirled with a pile of books in her arms, longing to learn. Cruz, in fact, established the largest book collection in Mexico at that time and defended women’s education and intellectual rights. At one point in the dance, Cruz takes off all her jewelry and undoes her hair, acting as a lifeless rag doll as she is forced to join the nunnery. She is later pursued by two men in suave black robes, but she remains holding a book. 

The following dance told the story of Manuela Saenz who is known as a feminist symbol of the Nineteenth century wars for independence in South America. The dance tells us that she was romantically involved with Simon Bolivar, a revolutionary hero. He blindfolds her, while they pursue each other around the stage. Later, Saenz leaves, and emerges in uniform, the same as Bolivar. Her defiance surprised the crowd; they were pleased to see her in a new light. 

After an intermission, the company performed more traditional selections of flamenco dance. It was impressive to see the different variations. One, Martinete-Seguriya, featured the entire group dancing to complex rhythmic patterns. Seguiriya is one of the oldest flamenco dance forms where the heaviness of the music interplays in the performance. Here, the dancer gets to express sorrowful emotions while dancing through an intricate and complicated song. The crowd was struck by the pauses in each piece. Every dancer maintained complete solidarity and the intense tempo. 

A crowd-pleaser of the night was Estefania Ramirez performing the Soleares. Considered one the the most serious and deep palos in flamenco, the Soleares is a dance that shows a person’s dedication and integrity. Ramirez was certainly well-fit for the demands of the song. Her feet skirted across the stage, rapidly tapping and creating percussionary accompaniment. It seemed to never end; she shocked the crowd by completing an overwhelmingly intense set, only to immediately begin into another. Just when the crowd would think it was done, it was not. She elegantly conveyed the mood of the piece, while also showing the gritty technique of flamenco. 

The final number of the night was Pa’ Triana, a work that shows how neighborhoods in Seville all share their love for dance. The entire company came out snapping for the opening of the song. Intertwining with one another, they alternated with the musicians in singing. They would form a semi-circle, while one individual danced in the center. Describing the company is like trying to picture a high-functioning, efficient machine. Every dancer served their role in the performance, and they all danced with a unified and coherent energy. Flamenco Vivo danced to tell stories, to create a tapestry of their culture, and to showcase their passion for flamenco dance. As the performers bowed, they were just as happy as the cheering crowd was.
