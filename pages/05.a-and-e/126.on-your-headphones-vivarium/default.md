    As I was searching for an album to review this issue, I was notified that my good friend, Flwrs, had just released his fifth album, “Vivarium”. Flwrs (pronounced “flowers”) is a producer and composer who hails from Minnesota and South Dakota, and is also a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. He has been creating music since 2012, with multiple releases under his belt. Flwrs describes his music as “combining the elements of hip-hop, pop music, and classical music.” He has frequently collaborated with artists of different genres, and strives to craft calm and cute tunes for his listeners. 
“Vivarium” contains 13 songs and one instrumental for a single Flwrs released in 2019, which featured the artist, scum. Starting off, we hear “Gardenia,” a lovely piece that simply breathes life into the dull days and cloudy skies of Minnesota winter. With a well-rested mind and soul, we move into “Puppy,” a similarly dreamlike sound with soft piano and violin, which continues for the next two songs, “Teddy Bear” and “Ladybug.” The entire album radiates one word: cozy. Whether you have woken up energized or simply stayed up a little too late the night prior, Flwrs is constantly working on new pieces to grant you peace of mind right in the comfort of your home. Check out “Vivarium” when you have the chance: it will raise your spirits and make the sun shine brighter than ever.
Flwrs can be found on Soundcloud, Bandcamp, Spotify, Apple Music, and iHeartRadio.
