I’m a fan of Robin Hood, and I’m a fan of Taron Egerton. Despite not knowing this movie even existed until a week ago, I saw it anyway. And let me say, Otto Bathurst’s 2018 adaptation of Robin Hood falls short in so many ways.

I will say the cast did a fantastic job: Taron Egerton, most famous for his performance in Kingsmen and its sequel, provides a lot of heart to the titular Robin Hood. However, his performance does a lot to echo his performance in that film: he’s a cocky, brash, but caring young man down on his luck, aided by freed Crusade captive John (Jamie Foxx). Together, they steal from the rich Sheriff of Nottingham (Ben Mendelsohn), and uncover a grander conspiracy about the crusades.

The cast really elevates the movie, especially the master/student/bromance relationship that Egerton and Fox have on screen. However, this is ruined by a lot of misguided direction: a meaningless romance subplot that distracts from the action, a villain with uncertain motivations, Friar Tuck (Tim Minchin) being an oddly unnecessary comic relief character. It all adds up.

The aesthetic and dress of the movie is also very odd: it’s clearly supposed to be set in the 9th-ish century, but everyone’s outfit and the building structure makes the world look like a melting pot of Black Hawk Down, House of Cards, and Lord of the Rings: the sheriff wears a leather suit, and apparently London soldiers work for the American military, and the giant mine in London looks eerily similar to the mines of Moria. It isn’t much, but the designs can be a bit distracting. Robin Hood looks like an Aeropostale model, not kidding.

Despite incredible performances from the cast, and an interesting concept, Robin Hood 2018 feels like a mish-mash of ideas, aesthetics, and direction that ultimately leave the movie feeling like a lukewarm popcorn flick at best, and an incomprehensible mess at worst. See it at your own risk.
