The UMM Girls Swim and Dive team saw success Saturday afternoon, January 20, at the RFC competition pool. The 18 person UMM team won with 125 points over Concordia College’s 84 points. The pool observation room was an array of students, parents, and even some professors. 

Starting out the meet was the 200 Medley Relay consisting of students Katie Beauto, Sierra Walker, Tatiana Walker-Rozo, and Liz Melssen. Walker caught up to the competition with her breast stroke, while Walker-Rozo kept even with the Concordia team with her fly. Winning the race, however, was Melssen with her strong freestyle. The team finished with a time of 2:04.62 beating Concordia by a quarter of a second. 

Next up, three UMM swimmers began the 1650 Yard Freestyle, a 66-lap race. Montana Lawrence swam strong after just competing in the 200 Medley Relay. She ended up winning the race with a time of 19:37.21. After an exhaustive swim, she took a couple of relaxing strokes to celebrate the victory. 

Another momentous race was the 200-yard Freestyle in which Caitlin Papke, UMM sophomore from Hutchinson, led the race with a time of 2:04.44. The crowd cheered in support as she represented her team with a successful win. 

One of the most captivating moments was when UMM swimmers Claire Naslund and Abi Fountain swam the 50 Yard Freestyle. Fountain ended up with a time of 28.12 seconds, while Naslund finished with a 28.18 second. The race was met with an engaged and supportive audience.
