“Get to know me! Get to know me! Get to know me!” Rohina Malik, the Chicago-based playwright, pleaded this while performing her one-woman show, _Unveiled_. The performance was held Friday, December 1, in the Proscenium Theatre in HFA. The play, funded by the Campus Activities Council, covers themes of racism, hate crimes, love, Islam, and culture. 

Combating the myths, stereotypes, and intolerances of Muslim identity, _Unveiled_ is a story of 5 Muslim women in a post 9/11 world who sit down for tea. Part one introduces Maryam, a dress designer that refuses to help brides because of her past experience at a wedding. Drinking chocolate chai, she describes a tense encounter between herself and a white man. The man said, “Take that shit off your head.” while Maryam retaliates with, “Do you know what it feels like to be treated not human.” She finds resilience through her children; everything she does, her children will imitate. By gaining the confidence to confront the white man, Maryam is giving an example to her children and for future generations. 

The second character is Noor, a girl drinking Moroccan mint tea. Throughout the monologue, Noor explains how she fell in love with Joe, a Muslim musician. One night, the married pair are attacked by a group of teenage boys. Joe is stabbed, and Noor is raped. She describes the pain and shame she fell into after the event, how it took a large effort for her to speak at the hearing. Noor remarks on how her mother encouraged her to tell her story: “Silence is sometimes a crime.” Her point spoke for women of the entire Muslim community. Her mother says: “Don’t ask, ‘Why me?’ Ask, ‘What for?’” 

In part three, Inez is introduced to audience members, drinking bitter Kahwa Sada coffee. Her story tells of the immediate moments following 9/11. Inez describes viewing the terrorist attack on the television in a convenience store she often visited. Receiving disapproving and angry looks across the room, Inez flees the convenience store, retreating to her home. The five city blocks she walks are filled with fear. She is told by numerous strangers to take her hijab off, saying how dangerous or stupid she is for wearing it. She describes sobbing through the streets, unable to maintain her composure. After overwhelming pressure, Inez removes her hijab, running to her home. “That day, my rights were stolen,” she said. To Inez, this problem is not just for Muslim women. “Today it’s my rights...tomorrow it could be yours.” She drinks bitter coffee to remind herself of the bitterness of that day. 

“My name is Shabana Abdulaziz and I long to know where home is.” Part four of _Unveiled_ began with the introduction of Abdulaziz, a hip-hop artist in London. She asks the crowd a simple question: “What do you represent?” Abdulaziz represents Islam, and it was hip-hop that made her realize that. Drinking Pink Kashmiri chai, she describes how racism is alive in America. Abdulaziz’s mom was constantly obsessed with fair skin. Abdulaziz was told by her mother that she must wear special makeup to make her skin lighter. Racism is also shown through the veil, a symbol of controversy. Abdulaziz notes how the veil is never debated when it is on a nun’s head. When told that nuns wear a veil for God, she replies “What do you think I wear it for?”

The fifth and final character of the performance is Layla, a restaurant owner. She just received news of the attack on the Twin Towers and immediately thinks of her brother, who lives in the area. She also receives news that a bomb threat has developed where her children go to school. A mob has formed outside the school building, with crowds chanting, “U.S.A!” and, “Go back to your country!” The events reflect the attitude that many believed that American Muslims were responsible for 9/11, an idea that Layla seeks to disprove. After arriving at the school, a boy violently approaches Layla, screaming hateful rhetoric. “Remove the veil from your heart” says Layla. She seeks to find peace in the midst of hate. She wants to be known, to be valued as a human being. “Get to know me. My name is Layla.” She recounts all this while drinking Sage tea, a drink often served at funerals. 

After the performance, Malik answered questions from the crowd in a talkback. When asked what inspired her to write _Unveiled_, she stated the play was an opportunity to help break the stereotypes of Muslims. Seeing the thousands of deaths in 9/11 and the increased prejudice and discrimination against Muslim Americans prompted Malik to write the play. She observed how you need two things to make a hate crime: a negative stereotype and degrading language. Malik collected personal stories, research, and interviews to craft the women’s stories in _Unveiled_. 

“When you know someone, you can’t stereotype them.” Malik hopes that her message will reach all audiences and bring people of different faiths together. She hopes theater will continue to unite us and encourage us to tell our stories, like the women serving tea. Up next on the Campus Activities Council Performing Arts Series is Gaelynn Lea, a classically trained violinist and songwriter. She will perform Friday, February 23 in Edson Auditorium.
