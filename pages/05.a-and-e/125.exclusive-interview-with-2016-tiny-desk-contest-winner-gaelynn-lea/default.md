On Thursday, Feb. 18, my colleague and I had the pleasure of interviewing Gaelynn Lea, the haunting violinist of Duluth, Minnesota. Lea has performed all across the country, in 45 states and nine countries, astounding her audiences with a clever blend of traditional fiddle tunes and original songs. 
She has already appeared in SXSW, Winnipeg Folk Festival, and the Reykjavik Arts Festival, and has also opened for a number of bands such as Wilco, Pigface, The Decemberists, The Jayhawks, and LOW.

“I started learning violin when I was ten in middle school orchestra. There was a lot of other students so we had to take a music listening test in fourth grade if we wanted to join in fifth grade, and I was the only student that year that got a perfect score. And so I think that’s why the teacher was so motivated to try to help me adapt the way I play, because I have a disability [osteogenesis imperfecta] - you know, I’m in a wheelchair and my arms and legs are shorter and bent - so I couldn’t play the violin up on my shoulder. [...] Eventually, we figured out that I could play the violin up and down like a cello and then I hold my bow like a bassist does. The beginning, it was more of just something fun that I did with my friends but over the years, as I got more and more involved with music, it became more of a passion. I didn’t start thinking about performing professionally until after college. It was really just something that I did for fun.”

Lea has released three full-length solo albums, as well as a number of live sessions. Her rendition of traditional fiddle tunes, such as “Swallowtail Jig” really make the piece stand out as more than an old fiddler’s tune and more like a mysterious trance that the listener can lose themselves in. 

“That song is vividly visual to me. When I play it, I picture a boat rocking on the choppy seas, and I really enjoyed working on it with the pedal,” said Lea.

 A few years back, Lea performed here at UMM and played a number of pieces pertaining to interpersonal relationships, as she was in the middle of wrapping up her 2018 album, “Learning How To Stay.” When asked about how these messages in her music have translated into her experience with the pandemic, Lea responded by noting that some songs “evolve as you evolve,” such as “This Hunger Won’t Leave,” which she had written two months before lockdowns came into effect. The music had not been written into a pandemic headspace, but Lea feels that, depending on what you believe,we get struck with inspiration that comes from something separate from our conscious mind and instead from “an overarching energy that drives creativity.” 

When the coronavirus lockdown took effect, Lea and her husband headed home from their Colorado tour and prepared for the end of her memorable concerts for the foreseeable future. However, this was far from the case, as Lea started putting out live performances from her home, eager to connect with her audience no matter what it took. After all, as NPR Music’s 2016 Tiny Desk Contest winner, Lea was already becoming a well-known name in the states.

“You can’t control anything really, and so just having to let it go and be in the present moment has been helpful. [...] I think music has been a grounding point for a lot of people this past year, and that’s why doing those concerts has become a really important part of how I feel I can contribute during this difficult time. Certain songs have been meaningful for the audience at different points of the year, and they will request songs for different reasons.”

Lea’s started hosting regular Sunday shows from Mar. 22 to present day on her YouTube channel, titled “Quarantine Concerts,” which have become a nexus for the violinist’s improvisational pieces, as well as her well-known original songs. Recently Lea has been featuring a guest artist each week, with guests selected from around the world. Real-time captions are provided for deaf and hard-of-hearing audience members. These performances are free to the audience, although tips are encouraged (and are split with the guest artist each week). In addition to her “Quarantine Concerts,” Lea is currently working on a memoir about her touring adventures and disability advocacy that she plans to release in 2022. 

When reflecting on what we have had to do as a society, Lea quoted her song, “The Long Way Around,” by saying “try not to burn the careful ties that bind us together.” The whole world is dealing with the pandemic differently, and with those who are more susceptible to the pandemic not being taken seriously, sometimes we need to simply acknowledge the struggles that we are going through, before pushing forward and enjoying each other’s company in a remote manner. For Lea, hosting guests for her “Quarantine Concerts” has been eye-opening with people who she would have never been able to meet, as she has been unable to connect with her touring friends. The technology, she added, is not too difficult to gather for meeting people in a socially distanced manner.

In closing, Lea had something beautiful to suggest to those who are finding it difficult to keep themselves busy during these trying times.

“I read an article recently about how it is hard to really relax and typically, we end up scrolling through our phones before we go to bed. Instead, we should try learning something new every day. For me, I have been doing courses online and learning how to use new music technology. Expanding our minds, rather than just ruminating on what is going on is a really healthy way to get through this, with listening to new music being a great way to do that.”
