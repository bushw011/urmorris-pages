On Thursday October 29, English Club and Briggs Library came together to host a Halloween reading and trivia night. The event took place on Zoom, with the meeting starting at 7:00 P.M. Tess Walker and Peter Bremer hosted, with Tess leading the evening’s activities, starting with some Halloween trivia. Attendees were asked a series of questions about Halloween, classic horror stories, and obscure poetry references. Each question was multiple choice, with attendees being given roughly a minute to type their answers to Tess. The attendee with the highest number of correct answers was rewarded with a ten dollar Higbie’s gift card. 

Let me tell you, it was not easy to achieve – there was a fair amount of guessing involved. How many of us could have guessed that the setting of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein was the Arctic? That Halloween was originally a religious holiday? Truly, these were wonderful surprises. After being bestowed with a lovely amount of horror movie (and poetry) knowledge, it was time for some spooky storytelling. There were four readers, and each excerpt was absolutely bone-chilling. There were readings from the works of Edgar Allen Poe, as well an excerpt from the 2019 film, “Midsommar”, a fictional tale and haunting adaptation of the Swedish mid-summer festival. All in all, it was such a treat to share our collective appreciation of the pagan holiday over the Zoom call. 

For those of you who missed it, I have added an excerpt from Edgar Allen Poe’s short story, “The Tell-Tale Heart”:

“ True! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you the whole story.
It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees --very gradually --I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.
 
Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing”.
