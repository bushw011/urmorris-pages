On Monday, February 26, the Morris Chamber Orchestra had their first concert of the spring semester. Morris’ Chamber Orchestra is led by Alexander Corbett, a conductor and educator who teaches string techniques and chamber music. In the past, Corbett has also taught at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities and the College of Saint Benedict-Saint John. Corbett often works collaboratively with living composers and has conducted the world premieres of several new works over the years. In fact, one of the pieces used in this concert was being performed for the first time, and was written by a professor who Alexander Corbett studied under and worked with. The Morris Chamber Orchestra has achieved national recognition and often works with renowned guest performers.

The first piece performed was the Allegro movement of Felix Mendelssohn’s _String Symphony No. 6 in E-flat Major_. This light, dance-like piece was composed by Mendelssohn when he was only 12 years old. Starting off the concert with this piece was a wonderfully bold choice. The Allegro began with the orchestra playing in unison, creating a well-balanced sound that filled the recital hall. In addition to being musically powerful, this created a very neat visual effect in the precise and uniform bowing― or movement― of the performers. The visual effect combined with the powerful sound captured the audience and started the evening with enough energy to build upon and return to throughout the concert.

The second piece, _Four Miniatures for String Orchestra_, was special in that it was being performed for the first time. Each movement of _Four Miniatures_ was unique from the others, and Corbett stated that what he loved most about this was the contrast of the movements. Daniel Breedon, who composed the piece, is a friend of Corbett and was also once his professor. Breedon wanted to write a piece that incorporated all of his favorite qualities of string orchestras, and explains, “Since I knew I couldn’t use all of these in a single piece, I decided to write four short studies…” This desire to include many complex details clearly resulted in the amazing contrast previously noted. The result of the contrast between movements, as Breedon intended, expresses four completely different moods through the use of these special qualities of string orchestras.

The first movement of _Four Miniatures for String Orchestra_ was a high energy chase, with strong dynamics and strong bowing. The second movement featured the performers plucking the strings, and was light and upbeat. The third movement was bittersweet, flowing, and songlike. This movement was made up of beautiful, long phrases that evoke emotion in the listeners. The fourth movement was lively and cheerful, described by Breedon as “a jig for all of the instruments.” This piece was clearly enjoyed by all; Dan Breedon reflected upon how he enjoyed composing it, Corbett had wonderful things to say about the piece and its composer, and the audience enjoyed the complexity.

The third and final piece for the night was Bach’s _Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor_, a piano solo performed by Ann DuHamel. Ann DuHamel is a pianist and teacher at the University of Minnesota Morris, and teaches Keyboard Studies in addition to private lessons. Like Corbett, Ann DuHamel does a lot of collaborative work, and has commissioned new works from living composers. This captivating piece featured intricate phrases that moved the audience through the end of this performance, as well as the conclusion of the whole concert.

The Morris Chamber Orchestra will be going on a concert tour April 12-16, and will be traveling to several states throughout the U.S. On this tour, they will not only collaborate with high school orchestra students, but will also feature two student soloists. The final concert of the tour, on April 16, will be performed upon returning to Morris. Following the tour, the Chamber Orchestra will be performing a free community event on April 25 at the Morris Public Library. As always, the Chamber Orchestra and their dedicated conductor are working hard to prepare to perfect upcoming performances.
