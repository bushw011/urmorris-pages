I have had to priviledge to work alongside my friend Ahnaf in CMR Digital Media Production this semester. What he has been really excited to share with me is that he and his friend Janie Dam have launched a new show on KUMM called “Ahnafy’s Dam Show.” At first I thought it was “Ahnafy’s _Damn_ Show” because he was so damn proud of it! I still think he is damn proud of it, but Janie is damn proud, too. In about a month, his show has interviewed four musical groups from all over the world. That’s right folks, the world is their limit. Both of them have connections with artists from all over the place, ranging from the States to Bangladesh. Their show goes on for two whole hours that are divided into two parts. The first hour features music of exclusively their featured performer(s) and the second half is a live interview with them where they talk shop on all things from music to life. Their hopes are to best serve up KUMM listeners over the airwaves and online with the closest thing that they can get to a concert followed up with a live backstage experience. The two were gracious to me over fall break and took the time to answer all my questions about themselves and their show.

**1: When/how did the idea for the show come about?**
We aired our first broadcast about a month ago. Ahnaf had mentioned certain bands from Dhaka that he’s known are deserving to be heard internationally and it would be great to play their music on radio. I then mentioned how I also have connections to bands back in Chicago and so the idea of introducing underground musicians came about. We thought it’d be an interesting personal touch to do live interviews with weekly featured artists. -Janie

**2: Please explain again how you managed to get around the rule of not playing the same artist more than twice an hour.**
It was easy to work around the regulations since our show actually thrives to promote good non-mainstream bands and musicians, things actually KUMM stands for! The people on the board have been more than wonderful to us to make it work. I will give a huge shout out to the station manager! Carter Young is amazingly talented and deservingly KUMM”s commander in chief. No one does it better than Carter. -Ahnaf

**3: What sort of questions do you ask your guests?**
Once we get connected, we start off with your basic "What have you been up to," "How did the band meet," "When have you started streaming your music"--to "How is the music produced," "Who in the band decides what sounds complement what"--to "You ran into [so and so artist] at a McDonalds, what are they like in person," "Who in the band gets the most attention," "[This late member] is no longer apart of the band, did this affect the continuation of your music in anyway"--and so forth. -Janie

**4: What was your first band?**
Our first band was East Avenue from Oak Park, Illinois. Emanuel, the main vocalist, was one of the first people I told that this radio show is happening and he willingly said that the band would be down to do an interview, which is where that part of the idea stemmed. There were some technical complications with our call in that first run but they were very patient and still made great conversation. -Janie

**5: Who have been some of your favorite bands on the show?**
So far, we’ve only done four interviews; 3 rock bands, 2 whom are international, and one R&B producer. If I had to choose right now, it would be Owned. They were fun to talk to. -Janie
I’d pick Owned. They were amazing people and super friendly! -Ahnaf

**6: What is some background on one of the biggest bands you have had on your show?**
First of all, we don’t just interview bands. We have had amazing non-rock artists like Victor Cervantes who are worth listening to. But I think that a renowned band would be Nemesis. They’re pretty popular in South Asia, having toured internationally before they gained a big audience. Go listen to them on Spotify or iTunes! -Ahnaf

**7: How many people typically listen to the show online?**
We can't say an exact number since our radio station only lets us trace how many people stream us online. Janie and I make sure we put in a show that would be good quality as if thousands were listening. Doesn't matter if it’s one person or an entire country listening. Quality is crucial. But if you actually have to talk about number the lowest we had was around 19 streaming us online on a show we weren’t prepared for, luckily. It wasn’t our best day but we had fun. -Ahnaf
We also make sure to archive the broadcast for future reference. It was funny because Victor, an artist we had on, messaged me a few hours after his interview asking if there was any way his mom could listen to it because she wasn’t able to during our show time.- Janie

**8: What is the most amount of people to have listened to your show online?**
Again, we don’t know the number however I do remember seeing about 70 listeners on our episode once during the second half of commercials. There were more than a hundred on the third episode specifically. -Ahnaf

**9: What band has given your show and Facebook page the most exposure?**
We’d say Nemesis. They shared our event twice. Our page has more than 1,500 people and have a post outreach for a crowd of about 27,000 people per post. I feel like they were an amazing help. Victor, Owned, along with East Avenue are people we have to thank for that as well. -Ahnaf

**10: What bands are you going to have coming up after the paper is most likely published around the 20th?**
Another Chicago band called The None Others will be featured on October 21st! They’re a fun bunch with a lot of groovy music. We have more rock bands that are scheduled to be featured in upcoming weeks as well as R&B singers and even an EDM DJ. -Janie

**11: What is the most recent band you had on?**
Our last band was Nemesis! LISTEN TO THEM. I beg you. They are amazing. -Ahnaf

**12: What do you get out of this experience of having a show like this?**
I personally look at it as a collaboration with creatives that are making music and are deserving to be heard, just in hopes of giving them an audience outside of where they live and share their projects on a college radio show. Even saying, “they’re pretty good, huh? I went to school with them”--I think that’s really cool. -Janie

**13: What are some of the most noteworthy experiences you had with the show?**
The first time Janie and I got done with the first broadcast, we were listening to the recording in my apartment and practically judging ourselves in that first run. It is was interesting to know what the audience was listening to and we figured what needed improvement. We had so many mess-ups but it felt great to interact with our first band and to know that more artists are to come. -Ahnaf

**14: How do you get a hold of bands?**
Many of the bands and artists we have on are through personal connections however we are working to get renowned artists that are willing to chat with us through a budget [lol] -Janie

**15: What band(s) do you dream of having on the show?**
Although they’re not underground, it would be really cool to speak to all the members from Young the Giant! -Janie
I want to have Paul talk about The Beatles with us. I love The Beatles and I breathe and live The Beatles. One day I want the show to reach that level where I can invite him to do a show with us. -Ahnaf

**16: What would you say to someone who has wanted to pursue a KUMM show that is as ambitious as yours?**
It is so worth it and definitely an experience to get your hands on. Being live on radio! Make sure you have an amazing partner as Janie though, because you know what’s better than doing something you love? Doing it with a friend! Someone who will laugh at your mistakes, but still supports you. Janie Dam is that friend and partner in crime for me. Be sure that in whatever content you want to put out, it’s something that truly interests you and that you project it with confidence. The audience comes second to think about. -Ahnaf
