I recently came across a music video for Keiynan Lonsdale’s song, _Preach_ and, though I had no idea who he was at the time, the music video was so colorful and entrancing that I knew I just had to find out who this talented singer was. At the time, I was trying to discover some more queer artists and bands to listen to and broaden my taste in music and this song was by far my favorite to come from the search.

Keiynan Lonsdale is a gay singer, dancer, and actor from Australia. _Preach_ is one of his more well-known songs, and seems to have gained popularity ever since he played Abraham "Bram" Greenfeld in the 2018 movie _Love, Simon._ 

_Preach_ has been one of my most played (and replayed) songs these last few weeks, and has now officially made its way onto my faves playlist. Because this song has a lot of energy and is always able to improve my mood, this is the perfect song for walking to class or cooking lunch. The song and the music video are both amazing and captivating but anyone who listens to the song should absolutely check out the video for some amazing makeup and dancing from this _very_ attractive and talented musician.

It should also be noted that Lonsdale’s other songs are just as spectacular as _Preach_. I would strongly recommend the gay bop titled, _Kiss The Boy_ though I haven’t listened to it enough yet to give a strong argument for it other than it making me happy.
