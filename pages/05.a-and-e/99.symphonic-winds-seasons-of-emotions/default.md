On Saturday, February 29, UMM Symphonic Winds held their first concert of the year, Seasons of Emotions, in the HFA Recital Hall from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. Tickets were $5 for adults, $3 for seniors & children, and $1 for students. The program featured pieces that highlighted spring, summer, autumn, and winter. 

The first piece was Satoshi Yagisawa’s, “The Spring Sketches.” The song was inspired by “Fanfare – Young Pheasants in the Sky,” which is another piece by Yagisawa, which is intended as a sequel as well as an independent piece in its own right. The title reflects the season when this piece was written and the composer’s feelings at that time. The song has an airy, fluttering feel to it, like cherry blossoms gliding down the trees, carefree and full of joy. 

The second piece was Philip Sparke’s “A Winter’s Tale.” It features woodwind chords, distant bells, and a solo saxophone depicts a dawn chorus. The piece continues, and the sleigh bells get louder, with a wintry field being drawn most romantically. 

The third piece was Stephen McNeff’s “Ghosts.” McNeff’s theatrical background plays a special part in this piece, as every part of the piece (excluding the introduction) was introduced with a short poem. The story of the Grey Lady, the Dog of Godley, the Oldham Coliseum Ghost, the Polish Sailor, and Chorale all featured a vivid fantasy realm that only adds to the alluring quality of the music. The eerie, whispering tones made hairs stand on end, heart beats skip, and anxiety rise...all in a good way. Summer was gone, and October was on its way.

The fourth piece was, coincidentally, Eric Whitacre’s “October.” The pastoral melodies and corresponding harmonies are all reminiscent of the English romantic composers – Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst – composers who Whitacre, as a choral composer, is familiar with. According to Whitacre, “If the fall can create a sense of unease it can also convey serenity and contentment in the gold and reds of autumn hues.”

The fifth piece was Roger Nixon’s “Fiesta del Pacifico.” The piece is structured like a dance that makes frequent use of Spanish-Mexican idioms: it is impressionistic rather than narrative. 

**Director's Note**

For many of us, the passing of time evokes vivid snapshots of color and mood. As Laurie Lee writes in his book Cider with Rose: “The seasons of my childhood seemed so violent, so intense, so true in their nature. They processed us so completely they seemed to change our nationality. When I look back... it cannot be one place that I see but village summer of village winter, both separate.” Today’s selection of music reflects seasons and memories in different ways – from the energy felt by nature awakening in spring to the warmth and joyfulness of summer, and from the fading of autumn colors into the silence of winter.

I am grateful to my colleagues in the music discipline, the staff in the Humanities Division Office and Symphonic Winds alumni for their continued support. In particular, I would like to acknowledge Professor Bart and Sally Finzel and their generosity as founding donors of the Eve and Arthur Kugler Fund for Musical Instruments – a fund that Symphonic Winds will no doubt benefit from. 

Thank you for being with us this afternoon. We hope you enjoy the performance and look forward to seeing you at our Spring Concert on Thursday, April 23, or at a venue during our regional tour, from April 24-26.”
