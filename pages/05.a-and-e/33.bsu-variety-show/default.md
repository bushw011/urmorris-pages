The BSU Variety Show was held Thursday, February 15, at 7:30 p.m. in Edson auditorium, in recognition of Black History Month. The performance began with a group dance number, led by the BSU members. Shouting the BSU chant, they danced to a supportive and cheerful crowd. Some performance highlights were the BSU Choir, where a septet sang choral arrangements of pop songs by black singers, such as Michael Jackson’s “Man in the Mirror.” Directed by BSU President, Jamie Polahn, the choir performed in the organization’s choir robes that had been put pulled from storage for a BSU choir revival. Michael Weston recited a compelling poem, saying that “there was no golden age.” He encouraged the crowd to “breath for those who said they couldn’t.” Another poem, read aloud by two individuals, repeated the statement “Equality and I will be free,” with hues of red, green, and yellow appearing on the stage wall behind them. Other highlights included a group dance tutorial, in which BSU members taught willing members of the crowd how to wobble. While some crowd members showed their less-than-stellar dance skills, others surprised the crowd with their polished “wobbling”.
