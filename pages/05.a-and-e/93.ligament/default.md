On Friday, January 31, the HFA Recital Hall was once again graced with 2013 alumni Anika Kildegaard’s lovely voice. Accompanied by double bassist Will Yager, the duo is known as LIGAMENT, an ensemble committed to commissioning new music and creating new work for their unique instrumentation. LIGAMENT has performed at numerous concert series, as well as collaborating with other artists. They are set to release an album full of newly commissioned pieces in fall of 2020. 

The duo opened the program with “Phrases” by Katherine Balch, a piece written in 2017 specifically for soprano and double bass. Titled after the collection of poems by Arthur Rimbaud, Balch’s piece explores the restless energy held in four excerpt of his poems, with each phrase opening a distant memory and closing it abruptly. Interestingly enough, this piece was commissioned by Departure Duo, a soprano and double bass duo similar to LIGAMENT. The second piece was Paul Novak’s “not of longing”, a piece written in 2019 and commissioned by LIGAMENT for their 2019-2020 season. The piece is inspired by a short excerpt from Maggie Nelson’s “Bluets.” Friday was the piece’s debut, and it was fantastic.

The poem, which talks of love and regret, is easily found within the movements of this piece. Had I not kept face, I might have cried. The third piece was wildly different from the first two pieces, and it was Ramin Roshandel’s “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r.” Commissioned by LIGAMENT in 2019, this piece had a violent back-and-forth with calm, soothing movement and high-pitched, hair-raising notes. If I had to describe “r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r” with two words, it would be: “hauntingly beautiful.” The
fourth piece was Lila Meretsky’s “All Mute Things Speak Today.” Commissioned by LIGAMENT in 2019 at the Cortona Sessions, Meretsky’s piece has a new flavor that truly sets it apart from the previously performed pieces. Soft, warm, and loving, the piece carries the listener in a warm swaddle. This is up until a jarring sound from the bass shakes the listener awake, head swiveling, anxious. As Anika cries out, the devilish chords slowly die down, and the piece returns to a careful rocking. 

At the end, it felt as if the duo had performed for a ballet, that the six-minute piece had lasted over a three-part play full of mysterious intensity. The fifth piece was Beat Furrer’s well-known “Lotófagos (Lotus eaters).” Written in 2007, this piece is about the state of amnesia, and the piece is an allusion to Odysseus’ consorts who ate lotuses in order to erase their memories. The piece is consistent in style, with a faint whisper coming through the double bass, repeating, repeating, and then promptly forgetting. This song also seemed fitting for a film score, as it was masterfully crafted with moments of serenity and moments of deep uneasiness. The sixth piece was Amy Beth Kirsten’s “yes I said yes I will yes.” Written in 2012, the piece feels more like traditional opera than the rest of the evening’s repertoire. 

Her voice, rosy and powerful, creates a warmth that gradually builds throughout the piece, with the clever bassist carrying her voice across a dangerous landscape. The story built is quite personal, and I would highly recommend that people go out and give it a listen on LIGAMENT’s Soundcloud, or on their website, www.ligamentduo.com
