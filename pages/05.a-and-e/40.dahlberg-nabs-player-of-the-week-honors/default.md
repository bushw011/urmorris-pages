Minnesota Morris junior Paige Dahlberg has been named Upper Midwest Athletic Conference (UMAC) Softball Player of the Week.

In the Cougars very busy week, Dahlberg was very busy on the base paths. In six games in two days at the North Central Dome Tournament, Dahlberg went 9-for-18 (.500) to help the Cougars go 4-2 in the tournament.

Including the four games in Florida to start the week, Dahlberg batted .448 (13-for-29), scored seven runs, and drove in four.
