“Anybody can look at you. It's quite rare to find someone who sees the same world you see.” ~John Green, _Turtles All the Way Down_
Am I too old to be reading young adult novels set in high schools? Perhaps, but this book is totally worth a read. _Turtles All the Way Down_ is the story of Aza Holmes, a high school student with OCD trying to figure out how to be a daughter, a student, and a friend, while simultaneously investigating the disappearance of a local billionaire. Throughout the book, Aza struggles to cope with her immense anxiety about contamination and disease and Aza’s friends and family struggle to empathize and connect with her. Aza will frequently get caught up in anxious thought spirals that prompt her to wonder: can you really control your thoughts? If you can’t control your thoughts, are you really you? Is life a story you tell or a story told about you? It was both wonderful and heart-wrenching to journey with Aza through the book and try to answer these questions for myself. 

The book was funny, honest, and beautifully written. Green has an effortless style that is easy to read. I am a very slow reader, but I was so captivated by the story, and so connected to Aza as a character, that I finished the book in under 48 hours over Fall Break. Green’s last book, _The Fault in Our Stars_, came out in 2012 and his readers and YouTube fans (myself included) had been eagerly awaiting the release of this book. _Turtles All the Way Down_ did not disappoint. I cried when I finished the book, but not exactly because of any particular event. I cried because I was genuinely sad the book was over (also I just cry a lot in general). I’d felt such empathy and connection to Aza throughout the novel and it broke my heart to have to close the book and walk away from the story. It was one of those rare books that wraps you up in emotion and holds you tight until you finish it. When you finish the story, you are left feeling simultaneously full and empty. Reading the book was a great experience, but now that I’ve finished it, I have a sort of literary hangover. 

Like many of John Green’s past books, this book made me feel deep emotions and, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, I was especially moved by the honest way this book depicted life with a mental illness. I have been impressed for some time with the way Green speaks openly about his own mental health issues on his YouTube channel (_Vlogbrothers_). Writing this book was a deeply personal experience for Green because, like Aza, he has OCD. Green speaks pretty openly about his experiences with mental illness, in part, because he doesn’t think it’s anything to be embarrassed about, and partly in order to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness. We need to talk about it. His openness with readers and YouTube viewers has inspired me to be more honest with my family and friends about my own struggles with anxiety. This semester has been particularly hard for me mental-health wise and I have found great comfort in some of John Green’s words. In a YouTube video in 2015, John described what he’s learned from living with OCD saying, “Most importantly, I have learned that there is hope and when I feel like there isn’t hope, my brain is lying to me… How you feel when you are at your sickest is not how you will always feel.” So… this book review will now turn into a PSA: if you are struggling with any kind of mental distress, you need not suffer alone.
