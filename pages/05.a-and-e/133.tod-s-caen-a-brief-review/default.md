On Friday, March 12, the two Spanish-language-and-culture student organizations at Morris, “Vamos Juntos and Voces Unidas,” hosted an in-person, socially distanced showing of “Tod@s Caen,” a Mexican romantic comedy, in Edson Auditorium. The showing lasted from 7-9 p.m., with a moderate turnout. 
A classic but self-deprecating twist on dating tips and rom-coms, “Tod@s Caen” (“Everybody Falls” in English) follows two self-proclaimed experts on the opposite sex, Mia and Adan, who struggle in their professional lives but never hesitate to lecture their friends on how to get dates. Mia, a TV producer, makes a deal with her boss that if she can get Adan to fall in love with her using her oh-so-reliable tips, she will greenlight Mia’s new show. Adan, however, is determined to see through Mia and help his awkward friend Toby make it work with Mia’s best friend Margo. Of course, both are too smart to fall victim to the other’s tricks—or are they? 

If I were a film critic (which I’m not, I’m the co-president of Vamos Juntos), I would give this film a grade of C-, for not being as bad as I was worried it would be but somehow worse. Apart from being cliché and uncomfortably questionable at times by making fun of sexual harassment, Adan lives alone with a pet cat that we see numerous times throughout “Tod@s Caen,” but not once is he seen interacting with the cat or holding the cat, which leads me to suspect the actor, Omar Chaparro, is allergic. Is this normal for rom coms? Because most cat owners I know can’t resist showing affection to their cats, nor go a day without sticking their face in the cat’s fur and taking a deep sniff. In what universe would Adan listen to sappy music for hours on end but not even try to pet his own cat that he probably adopted himself? If you like Hallmark rom coms or just want to watch something in Spanish, maybe then “Tod@s Caen” would be a fun movie to try.  

And if you’re wondering why there’s an “@” in the title, I’m not sure, I couldn’t find an answer online. My best guess, as a Spanish-language learner, is that it was supposed to be a clever way of combining “todos” and “todas” (the masculine and feminine versions of “everyone”) into one word. Technically “Todos Caen” would have been a perfectly appropriate title, since it can refer to a group of nonspecific people and not just a group of men—plus it comes from the name of the main character Mia’s TV show—but the ambiguous “@” gives the title a double meaning (I think?) of “All Men Fall” or “All Women Fall.”
