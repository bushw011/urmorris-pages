On Saturday, November 11 at 7:30p.m. in the HFA Recital Hall, Morris Symphonic Winds performed _Music in Russet_. Overarching themes of their selection were “seasonal change - time - place.” Russet, “just like the type of potato” as Simon Tillier mentioned to get a good laugh out of the audience, is a color that well represents the changing color of our landscape as fall turns to winter. Tillier conducted Symphonic Winds, which was joined by applied trumpet lessons instructor Kenneth Jimenez, student soloist Jack Campbell on piano, guest oboists (also UMM instructors) and a barbershop quartet featuring students Spencer Hammerstein, Zac Hiemenz, Gunnar Grammond, and Liam Taylor. Most, if not all, quotes come from the program provided. 

First up was the piece “Northern Lament” by Derek Bourgeois (1941-2017). It was a last-minute addition to the performance “performed this evening as a tribute to his life and work” as the composer had died in the last month. “Originally conceived as the slow movement to his 1965 Brass Quintet,” it was “reworked in 1987” and “demonstrates the composer’s opulent yet sensitive style. For the most part tonal yet full of unexpected dissonance and chromaticism.” Symph Winds’ take on the piece surely exhibited ‘unexpected dissonance,’ complimented by intense percussion and constantly shifting textures.

Next was “Children’s March- ‘Over the Hills and Far Away’” by Percy Grainger (1882-1961). It was much lighter and much more joyous than the first piece. Accompanying Winds on this was the aforementioned barbershop quartet. It was an extremely lively and engaging piece.

“Tango-Tarantella” by Jukka Linkola (b. 1955) featured Kenneth Jimenez on trumpet. Jimenez’s melodies soared above the action of the winds throughout the piece. The song opened up fast and upbeat, then slowed down, giving Jimenez the opportunity to shine with a sparser accompaniment. From there the action then rose again to a more upbeat and fast tempo and ended with an almost sudden drop off from the Winds which allowed Jimenez to pierce the silence and leave an echoing reverberation in the recital hall. 

Following “Tango-Tarantella” came the “Paul Bunyan Overture” by Benjamin Britten (1913-1976), which, according to program note, “represents the quintessentially ‘American’ work of the composer’s North American years (1939-42).” Tillier remarks that the piece historically had a rocky premiere. The piece was “confined as it was to the composer’s bottom drawer following its withdrawal after the flawed premiere in New York in May 1941.” A side effect of that was that for many years they never got around to orchestrating the piano score that first accompanied the piece. 

“Woodland Sketches” by Edward MacDowell (1860-1908) was one of the most comprehensive pieces of the performance, as it is composed of seven parts. What shone the most were movements, “To a Water Lily” and “By a Meadow Brook,” played by Jack Campbell on solo piano. Campbell captivated the audience in “To a Water Lily” with a soothing performance that was a refreshing break from the complexity of the winds. As I listened, I envisioned a lilypad just out of reach, drifting away in the waves. From here followed “From and Indian Lodge” and “A Deserted Farm” which gave off a more somber feeling. Then Campbell came in again with “By a Meadow Brook” with a more uplifting mood. Throughout the song one could hear the babbling of a brook, as it were were downstream of the water lily. 

Wrapping up the performance was “English Folk Song Suite” by Ralph Vaughan WIlliams (1872-1958) which is broken into three movements. Part one, “Seventeen Come Sunday” was more fast- paced than all of “Woodland Sketches” with the winds coming in full force. Part three “Folk Songs from Somerset” concluded the performance with a cheery rendition that peaked the momentum of the entire performance. The piece kept the audience on their toes and made for an excellent closer to an overall wonderful performance.

If you are interested in other chances to watch Symphonic Winds perform, they announced a couple at the performance. Tillier was happy to announce an upcoming production titled _The Snowman_, based on a 1982 short about a snowman that comes to life. Their performance will accompany the film as it is projected on a screen for all to see. Featured at _The Snowman_ is also Samuel Yuan’s ongoing video production that compliments the theme of seasonal transition in _Music in Russet_ by showcasing Morris’s change from fall to winter. Lastly, Symphonic Winds announced that they are looking for donations to help students go on their tour to Alaska, May 16-26 of 2018. “Morris Symphonic Winds travels to Anchorage. Palmer, Fairbanks and Denali National Park to give concerts.
