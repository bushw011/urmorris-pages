Sometimes, we need music to get ourselves out of bed before an 8 a.m. class. Other times, we need music to self-soothe, to escape the trials and tribulations of the day-to-day. However, what about when we use music to ponder, to ruminate in our current existence? Whether you have been clinging to the memory of a budding friendship, or perhaps a difficult event from your past, there is a new album out that will simultaneously soothe you and coax you into working through these memories. In my humble opinion, this album is Future Islands’ sixth album, _As Long As You Are_. 

_As Long As You Are_ was released on Oct. 9, and came with a barrage of basslines and ‘80s synths, packed with heartbreaking ballads and vulnerable vocals. With this album comes a whirlwind of existential quandaries, as well as recurring issues in America.

The first song off of the album deals with acceptance, with realizing that we are deserving of a stranger’s love. “Glada,” which has become my go-to feel-good track for the past two weeks, starts off with: “New canopies arise//From the crumbling framework//The remnants of fire.” While first appearing to be a poetic slew of nonsense, the listener can continue to follow this tragic story of how an individual can no longer convince themselves that they are deserving of the simple things in life, such as the Swedish glada, a common bird also known as a Red Kite.
In an interview at Beat Route, singer Samuel T. Herring explains that he chose “Glada” as the opening track because: 
“Those opening chords, the sounds of birds, for me it’s like parting marsh grass or parting leaves and entering into a new space. And I love that as an entrance into a new area. But for me, I think it also really sums up a lot of the feelings on this album, which have to do with our feelings about deserving love, acceptance, trust and the way that sometimes we can feel that we don’t deserve the best things in life. And you know, as the writer, it’s me questioning myself, fighting with my own demons to say, ‘I do deserve love,’ and I believe that all people deserve these things in their lives.”

A good majority of this album follows the same theme as “Glada,” dealing with the difficulty of seeing one’s flaws and embracing them. “Moonlight” takes a darker turn, seeking love while being in a constant state of self-deprecation. 

Now, as Herring has stated in multiple interviews, the singer will create songs with loose personal ties, instead making a  point to address a bigger issue in this country. “Born in a War” is taking a jab at how America has handled gun violence, with less of a storyline and more of a series of questions being asked to the listener. As Herring puts it, “I work completely off feeling and vibe. I don’t really have an agenda—the world is an inspiration, especially right now.[...] We are in that mind state, a mental jail of our own making.” Another song, “Thriller,” takes a similar direction, somberly talking about the ongoing war against drugs, as well as alcohol. This song is harder to swallow, and frankly, I would not choose to add it to a relaxing playlist on a rainy afternoon. No, “Thriller” is about lamenting over what our society has tirelessly tried and failed to protect us from – chemical dependency, and the isolation that comes with seeking help.

Before I go on to write about every detail of the songs in this album, I implore you: give _As Long As You Are_ a listen. Although dark at times, this album will subdue those everwaking thoughts that keep you up at night. You will laugh, you will cry, and you may have more questions than answers, but you will work towards living in peace. From the lyrics of “Plastic Beach,” Herring invites us all into this synthpop saga with these tearful lines: “To be loved//To be one//To be loved//To feel some//Now I see, I see tomorrow//I see, I see tomorrow//And, ‘You’re my beautiful.’//‘And you’re beautiful just this way.’” A
