title: 'Paint, Sip, and Mental Health [Redesigned]'

On Tuesday, Sept. 15, the Native American Student Success Program (NASS) hosted the routine “Paint, Sip, and Mental Health” event in Oyate, from 3 to 5 P.M. This event was limited to 30 students, and attendees were required to RSVP via the Google Form that was sent out via email. These programs started last year, in October of 2019, and they continued throughout the academic year. 

When attendees entered the room, there were tables draped with white cloth and set with easels for each student, as well as a paint palette, paint brushes, and a rinse cup. After a kind and heartwarming greeting from Brianca, as well as a rundown of how the program was going to work, students were dismissed to fill their rinse cups with water and choose their paints (with pencils available for sketching).

Brianca Smith-Austin, the main organizer for this program, had a few words to say about the nature of the program and the possibilities for similar programs this semester. 
“The purpose of the ‘Paint, Sip, and Mental Health’ is for students to sip on refreshments that we provided pre COVID-19 and paint and artform to promote theirs over mental health. This program was designed to slow down and be in the moment while focusing on oneself and paint,” she said.

This semester, due to COVID-19 restrictions, the number of attendees, as well as the typical refreshments, were affected. There were no drinks, and students were asked to distance themselves as much as possible. 
“Last school year, we (NASS) did this program once a month. We plan to replicate the program and stick to COVID-19 guidelines and restrictions. At this time we do not know the frequency of the program but we plan to continue this school year as well,” Smith-Austin said.

The hope is that this program helps students hit the PAUSE button on what is usually a very busy time in the semester, and the program, as Smith-Austin put it, “Allows students to make something beautiful while managing academic rigor.” 
The room was filled with a positive atmosphere, with relaxing music playing in the background and Smith-Austin offering support with students’ paintings, as well as offering a listening ear. 

“I think every ‘Paint, Sip, and Mental Health’ is memorable. I remember one, in particular, over 50 students attended the event and there was not enough room or supplies and students were being creative and sharing with each other. I almost cried that day.”

One hour in, and another hour to go: there was no noise, only pencils scratching, easels being lifted, and soft murmurs of “okay, this is coming along.” The next 60 minutes seemed to fly by, as students shuffled from table to material, material to table, and out of Oyate with their finished piece. There was no judgment, there was no grade, there was only a deadline of 5:00 p.m. 

Tick...

Tock... 

Dancing with the clock.

Finally, I finished my piece and headed outside of Oyate to rinse my cup.
Two hours gone, and a clear head. This event is more than just painting. It is a safe place for all to take a seat, take a breath, and release some creativity on a blank canvas.

I gestured to Brianca and thanked her for hosting the event. When I asked, “By the way, when is the next one scheduled?” her response was absolutely moving.
“I get excited when students ask me ‘When is the next one?’ Every time I hear that question, I think to myself: ‘Today, a student said yes to their mental health.’ I think a lot of time, this generation of students is focused on being the best and excelling while neglecting theirs over wellness. Wellness is just as important as academic deadlines and I want this program to show that for students.” 

I strongly advise students to take advantage of every opportunity to better their mental health, and to book as many low-maintenance events as possible. 2020 is a year of shocks, surprises, and serious bouts of anxiety and depression. Whether you are routinely taking care of yourself, or this has all just started to catch up to you, take note: nobody is feeling okay. We are all scared, and we all need a few hours of tender loving care (TLC). Start a diary, Zoom call your friends and family, or pick up a canvas and some paints. If, like me, you are interested in painting but unsure of your artistic capabilities, Brianca advises you to “start today, it may not look the way you want it to look but sometimes you have to start somewhere.”

Keep your eyes peeled for more events to come up in your email, as well as on the UMM events calendar. Posters are still being put up, so take a picture and notify your friends. As cheesy as it sounds, we are all in this together. Stay safe, everyone.
