On Wednesday, Nov. 18, Symphonic Winds streamed their fall performance on YouTube. The post was made at 7:30 p.m. and lasted for 30 minutes. This semester, the ensemble has continued to meet under safe conditions following the guidelines provided by the Minnesota Department of Health. The ensemble was able to work with two composers, Jenni Watson and Christopher Hussey. 

The first piece was “Battle Symphony” by Adam Gorb, which consisted of nine movements. The first movement was warm and regal, with the cheery flutes and supporting brass instruments bringing a strong opening to the concert. The second movement started with, yet again, the flitting movements of the flutes, but tread very lightly with each section, as if locked in a special dance where each performer was given a small section of time to shine. The third movement, the reprise of the second movement, joined the sections together in blissful harmony. The fourth movement felt adventurous, as if the commotion had spilled outside of the aforementioned dance. A moment of silence, and the fifth movement begins with a bustling of activity. Scampering about, there seems to be progress in the tale being told through Gorb’s piece. There are moments of reflection and pause, before the mighty brass guide the group’s tone through mellow rhythms. The sixth movement, starting once again with the regal tone, signals the sounds of something new. Perhaps a new environment, perhaps a new element in the ensemble? They march in unison, until the seventh movement brings a hint of sorrow. Casualties, a sudden death for our travelers? The volume softens, and only rises with bowed heads and a quiet gaze. Yes, some adventurers were lost today. The ensemble weeps, but not without staying in formation. Luckily, the eighth movement brings the promise of a new day. Slowly, the group is lifted from their woes, and excitement builds in each section. The ninth movement is another reprise of the second movement, cheerful and mighty. A beautiful conclusion and we move to the next piece.

The second piece, Christopher Hussey’s “Dreamtide” (2020 version), begins not with music, but with text. The audience is presented with an excerpt from “The Dream” by Lord Byron (1816).

“Sleep hath its own world,
And a wide realm of wild reality,
And dreams in their development have breath,
And tears, and tortures, and the touch of joy.”

The first movement opens with long, drawn-out voices from the wind instruments, as if peering from the shadows. One by one, the ensemble joins, and their sound becomes one. There is caution, there is something amiss. The tone is a tad unsettling, with each breath of the ensemble hinting at something dangerous, something menacing in the distance, all shrouded in mystery. The second movement starts with yet another hushed voice, but this time, there is movement. Unified advancements from the ensemble to investigate, still in reasonably soft volumes. Ah, an echo of warmth, which is quickly hushed and tossed back into silence. Still, there is movement, they are curious. The brass pick up here, and carry their voices forward. The ensemble has decided to venture, and there is no turning back now. The group picks up energy and does not find any danger amidst. Softly, they return to hushed tones, no longer afraid. In fact, they sound quite triumphant. Suddenly, there is alarm, the volume is raised… but the third movement begins and we awaken. Was it all just a dream? Was there ever any real danger? This movement is calm, with the occasional quivering. Alas, we return to peace, to silence. The song ends.

The third piece is Jenni Watson’s “Rush Hour” (2020 version), which features Madison Grimsbo as solo clarinet. “Rush Hour” begins with a flutter of movement, calls from each section of the ensemble reporting for duty. Confident, uniform, and strong, the ensemble comes alive. A whirlwind  of commotion and there are small flurries of movement leaping into the air, one after the other, as if clamoring for attention. At one point, they all seem to halt for the clarinet, but only for a moment, as they are eager to jump back into the thick of things. Finally, the clarinet is awarded her solo, and she fills every second with power. The ensemble claps behind her as she dances to her mighty tune. There is eventually a pause, a graceful descent, and the ensemble is once again a hustle and bustle of activity. One last mighty roar, and the piece ends.
 
The fourth piece, William Rimmer’s “The Cossack”, begins with a strong presence. The cymbals alive, the heart of the ensemble is bursting with might. Unlike with the previous pieces, there is not a moment to waste, not a second to dawdle in hushed tones or cautious wavering. The powerful marching continues, and with the trumpets in tow, they are victorious.
 
The fifth piece, Chris Hazel’s “Mr. Jums”, from “Three Brass Cats”, is once again relaxed. 
 
The sixth piece is the world renowned “Farandole” by Bizet. A timeless piece, the roars of the melody are echoed in the auditorium, not a word in this language fit to describe such raw, unbridled emotions. Time and time again, we are moved to our feet, then forced to sit back down, to submit to the chaotic good that is Bizet’s work. 
 
The seventh piece, Ernesto Lecuoña’s “Malaguena”, opens with cries from the brass, signaling the arrival of something, or rather, of someone. There is commotion among the other instruments, and the tempo picks up. A skirmish, perhaps? Tensions are high. In the end, the ensemble celebrates their victory with trumpets in the air, their cries heard from far and wide. The clicking of the castanets and the gradual inclusion of the cymbal signal the close of the piece and the performance.

There were many pieces played and several memorable moments from the overall performance. Once again, the drive and determination from the campus community kept our annual tradition alive and well.
