Open Mic Night provides an artistic outlet for people to share their work. It builds a community in Morris that supports creative students and provides entertainment to others. Thursday, November 30 was the last Open Mic Night of the Fall 2017 semester. There were seven performances in total, all of which were musical. The night started off with a cover of the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ “Wet Sand”, performed by Thomas Pederson. “I interpret the song as being about showing your true self to people you care about instead of presenting a facade that you think they will like,” Pederson later explained. He had chosen the song two months earlier, and spent a lot of time and effort on it leading up to Thursday night. 

Following Pederson’s performance, Dadbot 5000 performed, but for the night was renamed “Dadbot 250” seeing as the other half of the band, Nick Bushway, was missing, leaving Jon Antonson to replace his friend. In his place was Ahnaf and a returning performance from Pederson. The performance included a request for shoutouts from the audience, asking for their frustrations, which were incorporated into that night’s rendition of Antonson’s “Eat My Ass.” Antonson then jokingly quipped, “We already played all the classics,” and moved on to other songs. One song performed by Antonson was inspired by Nick Bushway’s experience working at Subway. Antonson ended his performance with another original, “Mitt Romney (You’re Beautiful).”

Later in the night, Salvi Alam and Ahnaf Yasin came to the stage for an impromptu rendition of a  traditional song in Benghali. The song was prefaced with a short interaction between the duo, with Yasin stating, “He planned this at 9p.m.,” followed by Salvi claiming, “I said we _can_ do this, not that we _should_ do it.”  Salvi left the stage after the first verse and Yasin stopped abruptly with a joke and started a song dedicated to Antonson and Pederson. The song was an acoustic rendition of Madness by Muse.  

The next act was Hannah Fussy, who entered the stage to resounding snaps from the audience. She performed Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song,” which she mentioned was picked last minute. She also anecdotally told the audience that she had performed the same song in the past for choir.
Following Fussy was a duo who gave the event some Christmas cheer, even though it was not quite December. The duo consisted of Ariel Crabtree and Hannah Sajulga, who sang “Deck the Halls.” It was a great way to end the last Open Mic Night before the long holiday break. Open Mic Night will continue next semester, once a month on the last Thursdays of the month at 9 p.m.
