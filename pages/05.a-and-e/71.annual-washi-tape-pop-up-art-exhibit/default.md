Stuck Up, the fifth Annual Washi Tape Pop-up Art Exhibit was held in the Morrison gallery from April 5 to April 12. The art exhibit was focused around Washi, a special Japanese tape which is made from rice paper, which is similar to American masking tape. Students used different colors and layering techniques to create images using washi tape, and displayed the images on the walls of the Morrison gallery, with recurring themes of nature and motivational messages. There were also a variety of cast objects, with many of those also reflecting themes of nature. 
The Morrison Gallery is pleased to announce that there will be one last art exhibit in the semester, the Annual Senior Art Exhibit, which will be on display from April 17 to May 14.
