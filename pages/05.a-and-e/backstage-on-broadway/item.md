Siobhan and Peter Bremer would like everyone to know about the upcoming Spring Break trip to New York City. The program is a single-credit course that fulfills the theatre major requirement of Para-programmatic Experience, however, it is also open to non-theatre majors. The program will take place during the upcoming 2018 Spring Break from March 12 to March 17. As per a pamphlet about the program: In this 6 day/5 night course centered in the heart of New York City’s theatre district, you will see four theatre productions (on-and off-Broadway), take part in workshops and seminars, receive admission to the Empire State Building and tour Carnegie Hall, with free time to explore the city on your own. This will be the Bremers’ fourth time putting on this program. 

Upon arrival to NYC, participants will receive an orientation that will prepare them for a grand theatre experience in The Big Apple. After that, the first few days will have students seeing three Broadway shows (and one off-Broadway show); theatre workshops with a Broadway professional that give insight into Broadway’s history and the life of a professional in the business; gaining access to a host of experts including Broadway agents, casting directors, technicians, managers and actors; and touring Carnegie Music Hall and the Empire State Building. Participants will also have the opportunity to sit in on a special “after-theatre talk” with a show’s principal performer or technician in areas such as acting, sound, set design, lighting, stage management, props, projections, and directing. The after-theatre talk will be a session solely between these professionals and UMM participants. No participants have to perform or act, however, the theatre experience will give participants valuable insight into the many valuable skills that go into putting on big-theatre productions. Once participants are adjusted to the city life, they will have opportunities to visit other locations in NYC on their own time in small groups. 

Previous trips have included seeing performances of “Wicked”, “Billy Elliot”, “The Lion King”, “Bengal Tiger and the Baghdad Zoo”, and “A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder” among other performances. Stars students have seen include Daniel Radcliffe, Robin Williams, Idina Menzel, and Kristin Chenoweth. The shows are yet to be announced for this year, but the Bremers will ask participants about their interests and top show picks to guide their ticket-buying attempts. Participants have also happened upon various goings on in Time Square, such as the shooting of “30 Rock” and “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Other surprises from previous years include Liev Schreiber coming to visit them in their hotel and talking with the actor for Shrek in “Shrek the Musical.” 

Estimated cost for the program is $2,750, a price that includes the costs of shows, planned tours, hotel stay, airfare, shuttle costs (from airport to hotel in New York City), and assorted fees. Extra costs include meals, personal spending money, checking baggage, and any tours, travelling, or museum/gallery visits you plan on your own within the city. Participants are also responsible for their own transportation to and from the Minneapolis/St.Paul international airport. The deadline for the trip’s first deposit of a non-refundable $400 is October 20, 2017. Final deadline for payment of the remaining $2350.00 is set for February of spring semester. Participants will register for Backstage On Broadway TH 1040 during spring semester registration. Application materials can be picked up in the ACE office and must be returned to Stephanie Ferrian by Oct 20. See the ACE office for more information on deposit.
