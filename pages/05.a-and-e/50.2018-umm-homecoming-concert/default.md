Homecoming is one of the most lively weekends on any college campus. People, especially first-year students, have the chance to experience various events and the University of Minnesota Morris’ Homecoming Concert is no exclusion to this tradition. On an early Saturday evening of September 22 at 4:00 p.m., the campus’ three music ensembles performed a showcase that demonstrate the talents of Morris students. Conducted by Simon Tiller, Symphonic Winds was the first group to play for the Recital Hall. Two pieces were beautifully presented: Allerseelen by Richard Strauss and Toccata by Girolamo Frescobaldi.

After the audience members’ enthusiastic applause,  Jazz Ensemble, directed by Jonathan Campbell, gathered and offered a more upbeat vibe through the two classics that they performed: Blues in Hoss’ Flat by Frank Foster and The Jody Grind by Horace Silver.

Lastly, without the use of instruments and rather spending time and dedication fine-tuning their vocal abilities, members of the Concert Choir, conducted by Bradley Miller, assembled onto stage and gracefully sang an American Folk Song titled, Now Our Meeting’s Over, which swayed many, if not everybody, who was present in the room. From Four Madrigals on Rose Texts, Paul Mealor’s Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal was sang. In Portuguese, Muie Rendera, is an arrangement of two traditional Brazilian songs: one being the same title and the other called Lampeao. 

For understanding of this piece, the English translation follows:

Hey, lacemaker woman,
If you teach me how to weave, 
I’ll teach you how to flirt.

Hey, lacemaker woman,
The beautiful village girl
Has no other occupation
She only wants to stay at the window

Virgulino is Lampeao.
He is Lampa, Lampa, Lampa,
He is Lampeao.
His name is Virgulino,
His nickname is Lampeao.

I had been fortunate to catch up with a number of the performers after the concert to ask about their opinions and emotions regarding this first show. Here’s a further look:

“The Homecoming is concert is always one of our most important and well attended traditions because the music ensembles get to showcase all of the hard work that we have put over the first month of school. It is also a great opportunity for family, friends, community members, and alumni to come out and support the music discipline while attending all of the other homecoming festivities.” -Taylor Braun, Symphonic Winds’ Student Council President

“The Homecoming concert is a unique event that brings together three groups on campus that rarely perform together. It shows a small snapshot of the diverse range in music opportunities here at Morris.” -Anika Paulson, Symphonic Winds and Jazz Ensemble

“This year’s Homecoming Concert marked a shift in the difficulty of our setlist from years past. Normally, we’d have to save pieces as complex as the ones we performed [today] for later in the year because they’d be too challenging to work up in just three weeks’ time. Luckily though, this year’s ensemble has a huge amount of carryover from last semester in terms of players, meaning many of us came in experienced, both playing in the band and playing with each other, saving us time. It also helped that we all had a music retreat just a week before Homecoming where we had a chance to bond with each other and get some extra rehearsals in!” -Christian Pfeiffer, Jazz Ensemble

“The first concert of the year is always exciting because it’s the first time the new choir [members] perform together for the campus. It can be stressful to learn and memorize songs in such a short time, but it’s really rewarding in the end.” -Laura Steblay, Concert Choir
