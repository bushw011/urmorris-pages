On Thursday, March 5, the Annual Juried Student Art Exhibition opened to the public. Although they were only open for a short amount of time, I would like to invite readers to the University of Minnesota Morris Flickr, where all of the exhibition’s pieces have been photographed for people to view from the safety of their home.
This year’s exhibition featured works that showcased a number of mixed media pieces, as well as classic linocuts and ink on paper.
With so many themes being featured this year, there were quite a handful of pieces that had appeared in earlier exhibitions. 
One collection of frames featured works by Anika Dahl, Hope Guyer, Justice Anderson, and Gillian Orth. All are simple pieces hiding complex themes of beauty and loss. 
Dahl had multiple pieces featured in the exhibition, from her acrylic, “Still Life,” to her mixed media, “The First of Many,” and her charcoal pieces, “What’s Your Perspective?” and “Simplicity.”
Her pieces really speak to the soul, as “The First of Many” features a cracked light bulb, and the image feels like a soulless vessel just floating against the page. 
Anderson also had multiple pieces featured, from her oil on canvas pieces, “I’m Feeling Blue,” “Yggdrasil,” “Sunflower Void,” and “Dollar Tree, Aisle 4.” Justice’s pieces have so much life, one could almost smell the flowers. The colors on “Dollar Tree, Aisle 4” are simple and soft, with a lot of texture pulling the piece out of the frame. 
Hope Guyer, Cameron Schultz, Inaani Fox, and Driel Mortenson each worked on an ink piece, which were displayed on the main level of the gallery. It was refreshing to see artists expanding the definition of their pieces, rounding them out and adding a layer of emotion, all with a simple pen.
Upstairs, there was a collection of mixed media pieces, including Sophia Berkenpas’ “Decay,” which features lovely mushrooms popping out of a murky, earthy canvas; Nikolai Bjerke’s oil on canvas, “Dimner Tiem :),” which features the well-known shiba, Doge, being surrounded by a buffet; Susan Gilbert’s fibre and wire piece, “Left to its Own Devices;” Nicole Anderson’s mixed media, “Butterfly Book;” among many other pieces utilizing many different mediums. 
Bjerke worked with an impressive variety of mediums, with “Dimner Tiem :)” being an oil on canvas, “Insert a Good Title Here” being a graphite piece, and “Fluffy Man,” which is a lovely oil on masonite which has a cat and their kitten, peacefully cuddling. The textures in “Fluffy Man” are spot-on, and the detailing on the cat’s eyes are well-drawn, yet slightly unsettling at the same time.


Once again, I would like to encourage readers to take a look at the UMM Flickr, using the link below, to be able to fully appreciate the hard work that went into these pieces and the exhibition as a whole.
