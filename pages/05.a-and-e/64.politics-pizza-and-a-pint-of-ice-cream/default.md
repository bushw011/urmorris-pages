On Tuesday, February 26, Pi Sigma Alpha, Black Student Union, and World Of Color Association held a showing of “BlackkKlansman” in the Cow Palace from 6 to 9. The film, directed by Spike Lee and released in 2018, follows the unbelievably true story of the first African-American detective in the Colorado Springs Police Department, and his strategic infiltration of the notorious Ku Klux Klan. The movie showing was accompanied by an assortment of different pizzas, as well as ice cream with various toppings. Following the
movie, a discussion was held on the importance of the film’s message in decades past, as well as the rising concern in shadowed racial discrimination in present day. I sat down with Annika Johnson, the president of Pi Sigma Alpha, and asked her some questions about the event, Pi Sigma Alpha, and her personal opinions on segregation and discrimination.

**Why did you organize this event? What did you want attendees to get out of the event?**

Every year, each chapter of Pi Sigma Alpha (PSA) is eligible to apply for grant money towards an event or project for their chapter’s campus. This year, UMM’s PSA chapter, Alpha Zeta Eta, decided we wanted to use this grant to foster political discussion in a more accessible way: dinner and a movie. Given the polarized political climate we live in, making the theme of this series civil rights seemed incredibly appropriate and important. We wanted attendees to gain an understanding of the relevance of such themes today and most importantly to start conversations not only about how this relates to our political climate and culture, but also how to break down such treatment and stereotyping.

**What do you believe is the key to ending segregation and discrimination, be it racebased, gender-based, or LGBTQIA2S+ related?**

A changed behavior or mentality comes from a change in mindset and understanding. This starts with conversation as well as being educated on the facts. I’m a firm believer that sitting down and talking with people goes a long way to breaking down barriers and stereotypes. When we take the time to listen to one another, coming from a place of empathy and trying to understand rather than judgement, we as humans all have much more in common than we might initially think. That is why I believe this film series is so valuable. It’s starting important conversations here at UMM that will hopefully have a ripple effect.

**How was the event advertised? In your opinion, how did the event go (number of attendees, value of the discussion)?**

With just over 50 people in attendance, I was pleased with the turn out. The questions raised, observations made and connections drawn were powerful, and I know got me thinking. We will be tabling in the Student Center and have posters up throughout campus for the next two events this semester. There will also be postings to the UMM forum on Facebook. Will there be similar events throughout the semester? How can people reach out to PSA?

We have two more events as part of our film series. Our next event is Thursday, March 28, at 6 P.M. in Cow Palace. We will be watching “Do the Right Thing”, and again there will be pizza and ice cream. Thursday, April 25, we will be watching “Hidden Figures”, to conclude this three part series.
