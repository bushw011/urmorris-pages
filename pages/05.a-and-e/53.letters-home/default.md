The Performing Arts Series presented The Griffin Theatre’s _Letters Home_ in the second showcase of its 2018-2019 season on Friday, October 26 in the Edson Auditorium. The play depicts a powerful portrait of actual experiences from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. William Massolia, one of the two founding members of the Griffin Theatre Company, had been inspired by the 2014 HBO documentary “Last Letters Home” that tells the story of American soldiers who died in the Iraq war. Along with this, Massolia came across excerpts of letters that were weekly featured in The New York Times’ section titled “The Things They Wrote” in that same year and compiled over 100 of these war letters which are then brought to life through this production. The performance includes photos of the soldier experience which are displayed in the background as the cast recites the written events. With every transition between characters, the screen blacks out and reads the name, specialty, and age of the person that the actor is portraying. Several of the stories that are featured in the play begins with men being as young as 19 years old--excited to be enlisted in the army but through traumatic sights and harsh living conditions, their lives radically change in the sand-filled environment that is nothing less of danger. The letters are not only from combat soldiers but also from nurses on duty, new parents, and parents of those who enlisted.

They discuss the shift in perspective that some may experience regarding war. the One line a soldier had that written reads, “Just three months ago, I trusted these guys with my life. Now, they don’t even care if I live.“

Some became disgusted with the thought of war, or anything that reminds them of that matter. Another soldier says, “I never want to see another gun. The NRA can kiss my ass.”
While a number of the people from stories featured in this production are around today, many unfortunately faced the true cost of war. One soldier, a family man who had a newly born daughter, had constantly wrote to her. In the end, we learn that he had been killed just four days after her first birthday.

A young man often exchanged emails with his friend from home but because he had not been able to check his email, he had stopped responding and his friend subsequently stopped writing. The soldier eventually writes a physical letter to send and was fatally shot before his friend received it.

This is only a handful of the jarring thoughts that people had put down on paper and sent home. There are countless stories that are never told and with this in mind, we should always remember the sacrifices that the men and women have made in order to serve the country.

The Griffin Theatre started this year’s tour with the University of Minnesota Morris being its first performance. Their second stop will be in New York on Sunday, November 11 that would be just in time for honoring Veterans’ Day. Thank you to CAC’s Performing Arts Committee for presenting The Griffin Theatre’s_ Letters Home_ in rememberance of those who have served.
