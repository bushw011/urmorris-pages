Dance Ensemble (DE) kicked off their first show of the year on November 17 and 18. It had been a long process to get to the performances; auditions for the show were held August 24 and 25, and rehearsals started the week of August 27. With dedication and grit, dancers gave it their all while performing. 

Jackie Bell, co-chair of DE and a dancer since age four, commented on the process of putting a Dance Ensemble show together. To her, the casting for dances is particularly difficult. Right after auditions, the board sits down and spends hours putting dancers in dances. “We look at each dancer’s preferred styles, levels, number of dances, and their availability, and fit them all into dances that work for them and the choreographers.” Bell says that the process is a challenging learning experience. 

Ruby DeBellis, senior and also co-chair of DE, agreed that casting is one of the hardest parts of DE. After auditions, the board stays up til about 2 a.m. on a Friday night arranging each dancer in up to four dances. This can be considerably challenging because they have over 100 dancers per semester. Additionally, the board must schedule a space for each group to practice in once a week. 

The program started off with “Classic” by MKTO, referencing the theme of the show. The purpose of the opening number, according to Bell, is to get the audience excited for the show and to have a song that works for dancers of all strengths. 26 people were involved in this number, all dressed in red DE tee shirts. 

Caroline Vodacek reflected on their involvement in DE and how it has shaped their outlook on Morris. For Vodacek, the most difficult part of the process is bringing the dance to the Edson stage. It is often difficult to adapt to the other dancers on the stage; “Formations often make or break a dance and it can be difficult to be cognizant of where your fellow dancers are.”

Vodacek had experience in tap, ballet, jazz, and pointe before coming into college. Since age three, they have danced numerous styles. In the show, Vodacek loved dancing in the “River” number, by Bishop Briggs, choreographed by Mia Shaw. They said that their favorite part of the dance was when the group paired up and smeared lipstick on one another. Each dancer was taking on the role of a goddess who had been wronged in some way. “That moment when half of us are on our knees, the other half standing behind them, and the hand drags across the face, smearing the lipstick--there's a very strong emotion that sweeps through the auditorium.”

To craft such an intricate program, board members, dancers, and the technical crew must work extra hard during tech week. This is where the lights for the show are programmed and the dancers practice in Edson for the first time. While the process is exciting to watch, DeBellis remarked on how it can be tedious. Tech week starts the Sunday before the weekend of shows and “it’s basically a marathon until the last show ends on Saturday night.” To her, tech week is stressful but also full of great bonding moments with DE dancers. Board members enjoy one another’s company as they wait between the light cues and dances. 

The Dance Ensemble team and cast were incredibly proud of the dedication and motivation the group brought to the table this year. If you’re interested in joining DE or choreographing a piece, auditions are the first week of spring semester. Dancer auditions are in Oyate on January 18 and 19 and are divided by skill level. Auditionees only need to come one of the days. Choreographer auditions are January 17 and these individuals only need to perform 45 seconds of the piece they have prepared. Spring shows for DE are April 27 and 28. Feel free to contact Ruby DeBellis debel055@morris.umn.edu or Jackie Bell bellx724@morris.umn.edu for any further questions.
