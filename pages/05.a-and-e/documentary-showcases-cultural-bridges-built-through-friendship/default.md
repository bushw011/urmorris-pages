EDITOR'S NOTE: TRIGGER WARNING FOR SELF HARM / CUTTING

The UMMys premiered on Friday, April 13 at 9:30 p.m. in Edson Auditorium. Film creators, following a long tradition of Morris student films, showed off their finished projects of all sorts. These projects ranged from a short horror piece filmed on Snapchat to a 20-minute documentary on activism. Six submissions in total were shown. The event was hosted by CAC Films and the CMR Department. All of the directors this year took time to answer questions before the showing about about their movies and what it took to make them. 

Andrea Wathanaphone’s psychological horror “Beautiful” was the first piece to be shown. Wathanaphone played the sole character, a troubled makeup artist vlogger who was sent on a downward spiral over the course of her uploads. The film progresses from video to video as she deals with haters and trolls who question her makeup abilities. After each video recording, she can be seen reaching for a sharp object with which to hurt herself before the scene fade to black. This black period is where her piece shines due to the sound design elements she incorporates to tell all the gritty details. 

“My specialty is sound production and sound design,” said Wathanaphone, “[there is] very little actual footage and mostly sounds but a lot of editing to construe something of chaos and panic.” Wathanaphone says she prides herself in sound design so much that she is going to grad school for it and “Beautiful” is a testament to her practice. 

Sam Madden’s first of two pieces submitted, “Ghost Hunters,” shifted the mood from one of reflection to a more jovial one. Filmed over spring break with his friends, “Ghost Hunters” is a parody of shows. It centered on a band of ghost “experts” who make a living off fooling around with expensive looking “ghost detecting” equipment on somebody’s property overnight with various spooks scattered throughout. In place of flashy equipment they deployed a “wormhole detector” that was a dog whose tail they would check as a meter of how spooky the ghost. From time to time a haunted Amazon Echo would turn on and say something or other about “foot lettuce.”

Many of these ad-libbed moments stem from the creative control Madden gave his friends in the production. While he is usually the director or producer in his creative productions, he let his friends take over. 

“It definitely taught me that I don't really like taking charge over people, like telling them what to do because I want everyone's voice to be heard in the creative process. Because when you're making a film of any sort, if the people that are making the film aren't enjoying it, it shows. So you need to make sure everyone is enjoying themselves and having fun because that makes the overall product much better and much more entertaining." 

Justice Robinson’s “Little Red Cap” is a silent short-film retelling the story of Little Red Cap from the Brother's Grimm. Robinson said she had the opportunity to tell a fairy tale through film by taking a digital media productions course under Barbara Burke last semester. They were inspired to tell the tale because of a fascination with fairy tales, especially those from the Brother’s Grimm. 

“I love to find them and bring the really good ones to my younger siblings. I had found out that a friend of mine had never seen the 2005 Brother's Grimm film and we decided to watch it. This influenced the project of reviving my love of tales during the time of production.” 

Director Yicong (Samuel) Yuan’s “Mni Wiconi: Life After #NoDAPL” shifted. Produced and sound designed by Wathanaphone; edited, directed and filmed by Yuan, researched by Robinson and student Trey Goodsell, as a consultant “Mni Wiconi: Life After #NoDAPL” is a documentary about the lives of water protectors after they were physically removed from the No Dakota Access Pipeline protests. The piece was in progress for over a year because it required extensive traveling and coordination to meet with the water protectors. 

The film started as a class project last March when the crew got their first interview in Standing Rock. They followed up with interviews in May, November, and Thanksgiving, located in Eagle Butte, Seattle, to Standing Rock. 

“You can see the change of a person's mind after a huge movement like #NoDAPL.  Seeing what the water protectors have been going through because of the government, because of their personal choice. The ultimate goal from my personal view is to let my audience think about ‘Is it worth it to be an activist?’ and trying to reveal the truth about a water protector.” 

Yuan was drawn to the stories of the water protectors from the start. “For me personally, I wanted to turn it into a documentary film because I was so shocked the first time I met them, the stories they told me, the violence they saw at standing rock, the unfairness and treatment that they got from the government. So for me, it was a culture shock so personal that I wanted to learn more about what it takes to be an activist in America.” 

The activists stories are varied. To just name one, Anthony Gozatti, who goes by “Rhino,” says the whole experience is a blur. He speaks about how people accused water protectors of hurting the land they camped on and even though not long after they left, the land had restored itself while the other land scarred by the pipeline remained scarred. For Rhino, just seeing a police car makes him want to drive off. He says that, after all this time, “it still hurts.” What matters to him is the bond between water protectors. The smallest interactions matter whether it is a look, an unspoken moment, or a hug. “[It is] water protector life. It’s the only way you can describe that.” 

Madden submitted another ghost-inspired piece named “Spirit Sleuth,” also a product of Barbara Burke’s media production class, that once again provided relief from another hard-hitting and serious UMMy. Madden has a fascination with introducing the paranormal into narratives for a reason. "When you limit yourself to just what can happen in real life, it can be hard keeping that limiting factor. But adding elements of the fantastical… when you introduce things like that it makes its easier to make a more entertaining story that is believable." Madden uses that freedom to add a unique twist to the detective genre.

“[Spirit Sleuth] follows the adventures and misadventures of a somewhat green detective who has been possessed by the spirit of a more experienced detective.” To clarify, the inexperienced detective’s body isn’t possessed, but he is followed around by the experience detective. Madden’s character gets puzzled look gets when everyone who cannot see the ghost see’s him talking to himself. 

MicKayla Lizama and Sophia Chadborn’s “Studio Horror: The Darkening” ended the UMMys with a bang. They were inspired by the drying rack in the prints studio that “makes this ungodly squeaking noise. Sophia Chadborn, Caroline Vodacek, and I all thought it belonged in a horror movie about all the ways there are to die in the art studio.” The two said that they would describe their finalized piece as “Murder in the HFA--enemies of the art beware.” The plot is propelled from murder to to murder, each committed by a mysterious wooden figure that appears at the scene at the last moment and propels the survivors further into hiding from the violence. The whole movie was shot on Snapchat and posted shot by shot on their Snap story. 

“It was pretty fun--it took about 5 hours and we made it up on the fly. I posted it to my story after each scene. The responses I got to my account were really fun. ‘OMG,’ ‘SCARY.’’ 

A panel of outside judges had already preselected the winners before the formal showing.
