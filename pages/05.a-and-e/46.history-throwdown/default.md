The History Throwdown was held last Friday, March 30, at 7 p.m. in Edson Auditorium. The History Club-sponsored event pitted various groups of students against each other in a battle over who could give the best interpretation of a historical event for the grand prize of 50 dollars. The second place prize was 30 dollars and third place received 20. All in all, each performance could clock out at no longer than 5 minutes. 

The event’s special guest and judge was Rodney Richter. Richter, class of ‘87, graduated with a major in History. Not only was he a CA, but he also helped bring back the Tug-o-War when it had stopped for a few years. He now works at The Minnesota Historical Society as an interpreter. Before announcing the next performance, he would give some riveting Morris history for the audience. For example, he informed the audience that Atlantic Street and Pacific Street were so named because the train track situated between them was a synecdoche for the continental U.S. 

The CMR Club was the first performance of the throwdown. Claire Boeckermann, Andrea Wathanaphone, and Sara Carman were three unsuspecting victims of the hype that was the October 30, 1938, “War of the Worlds” radio fiasco that caught listeners who tuned in late off-guard. Michael Small played a young Orson Welles who was bored stiff of his radio theater job. The second that the radio show got spooky, everybody started losing their collective minds, because aliens. 

The second performance was “An Interpretive Dance of the Protestant Reformation.”  Trey Goodsell and Sarah Messer moved with grace in such a way that schooled me on that dense piece of history, using only their bodies. The amount of thought and coordination that went into the planning of the dance showed as they floated around stage. I give the piece 90 out of 95 theses. 

The next piece was “The Burning of the Library at Alexandria” by Jon Antonson and CJ Lee. Richter introduced the piece, joking that “you might want to call the folks at Douglas County.” The piece was accompanied by a video set in Briggs Library. Actors were librarians and students alike, recreating the events leading up to the burning. Sound issues prevented the video from playing pre-recorded dialogue between characters, but the two gave a faithful reading of the scene from the heart. “This asshole kicked out all the librarians!” said CJ Lee. Before long, you guessed it, the library burned. “There was a terrible cigarette break that went horribly wrong,” explained CJ Lee. During the last moment of the piece, Breanna Flanegan burst onto the stage, dressed as if she had barely escaped the fire. I give it a solid “fam, it was lit.”

From here, Antonson once again took the stage for a solo rap he titled “Trapped in the Reins of History.” It is about a man who was birthed to Queen Isabella of Spain. When Queen Isabella and Ferdinand II of Aragon got married, they kicked this man out of their house. He ended up heading to different countries and starting revolutions in all of them. 

Next was the piece entitled “The Guacamoles,” put on by the Muslim Student Association (MSA). Various historical figures throughout time and from around the world gathered to put on a birthday party for Mahatma Gandhi, but things went awry when clashing values between figures made party planning difficult. Figures include Omar Khayyam (Esmira Alieva), Frida Kahlo (Christina Kotten), Martin Luther King Jr. (Jamin Stagg) , Theodore Roosevelt (Josiah Gregg), Ibtihaj Mouhamed (Fahima Guemri), and Malcolm X (Kriss Baye). Alieva took time to sit down with me and discuss the themes of the piece. 
MSA’s intention with the piece was to “show how inclusive community could be and should be with a historical way of explaining it.” The road to inclusivity could be rife with road bumps because of contradicting views of these figures. For example, Ibtihaj Muhammad did not want alcohol at the party and Roosevelt did not want Malcolm X as Roosevelt had been criticized by white people for inviting Booker T. Washington to the White House in 1901. However, they overcame their differences in the end because regardless of their differing beliefs, they could “still celebrate [Gandhi’s] birthday together and be a part of one community together.” Alieva closed the piece with a quote from Khayam: “If you hope for eternal rest, feel the pain yourself, but don’t hurt others.”

Bringing greater musical variety to the show and ending the competition was Ben Holman with “A Bassist Named Ben with a Song about Plutarch.” Plutarch was a Greek-Roman historian and the song paid homage to him though a cover of a newave song from the ‘80s. By popular demand he started playing “Wonderwall,” which the audience joined in on, singing ahead of when the lyrics of the song were actually supposed to kick in.

Richter took five minutes to judge the pieces. In addition to the top three awards, Richter spontaneously added two other awards to be won. MSA’s “The Guacamoles” won “Most Inspirational”  and CMR Club’s “War of the Worlds” won “Best Historical Freakout Recreation.” Third place for $20 was given to “The Burning of the Library at Alexandria,” and “An Interpretative Dance of the Protestant Reformation” scored second place and $30. Coming in at number one was Ben Holman with “A Bassist Named Ben with a Song about Plutarch.”
