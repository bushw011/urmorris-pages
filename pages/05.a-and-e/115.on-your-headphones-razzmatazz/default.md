This past year has been filled with so much drama, I thought that I should look for (yet again) an album to soothe our souls and wash our worries of the remaining weeks of 2020 away. I do not know how we got to be in such a mess, with the pandemic and this election (writing before the final results have come through), but I think this collection of tracks will do the trick. I present to my dear readers, Razzmatazz by (warning: long band name incoming) I DON’T KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME.
Once again, this is a band looking to redefine the ‘80s through masterful tracking and long hours of writing the right lyrics to fit the aesthetic. Interestingly enough, the band (name typically shortened to IDKHOW) was planning to release this album back in 2019, but was “...delayed due to an unexpected amount of success in playing shows”, according to lead singer and bassist, Dallon Weekes.

	With twelve songs (technically fourteen but two songs, “Indoctrination” and “Tomorrow People”, being exclusive to physical copies of the album) and each track except the title track only being between 90 seconds or 3 minutes long, IDKHOW delivers short bursts of excitement with each song. Most of these songs are polite rants from the band, discussing the toils and troubles with Hollywood and the music industry. Dallon noted his general distaste for Los Angeles culture in an interview with ALT 104.5 Philly.
    
“When it comes to entertainment business culture and the Hollywood culture … the town is the embodiment of narcissism and the strangest personality disorders–every last one of them. It’s all embodied in that town. And if you don’t have the right car or the right clothes or the right friends, then … it’s the kind of place where people would step on your neck as soon as they would assume to look at you”.

The album consists of two tracks which were previously mentioned as being exclusive to physical copies of the album. This being said, the band caters to their audience, even dedicating one of their songs, “New Invention”, to thank their fanbase for being so patient with the delayed album release. The band had a rather sweet Twitter post on October 1, breaking the bad news to their fans but also releasing this specific track early, closing the tweet with “Thank you for your patience”.

Another track, “From The Gallows”, was written in the perspective of someone who is madly in love with someone, to the point where they label it an obsession. The track has a steady rhythm, rocking back and forth with lyrics that dance near the edge of insanity.

I promise, I will try breaking away from 80’s synth and try getting back into the usual rock/electronic music. For now, enjoy yet another feel-good, nonsensical, enticing album. Who knows, maybe you can give Razzmatazz a listen and see the same kaleidoscope of color that I did. Kidding, kidding...unless?
