A while ago, I wanted to find music that was delightfully scary, but simultaneously fun to listen to. I had been disappointed in years past by the misconception that the only scary sounds were disharmonic wailing and cackling or marimba notes set to dancing skeletons. So, I went to Youtube to try and sort out the scary music scene genres once and for all.

**Witch House**

Witch House is what a satanist rave cult would listen to. It’s all the fun of Daft Punk with all the creepiness and campiness of B-rated horror movies. It’s an interesting mix that manages to unsettle and inspire the urge to dance at the same time.
Modern Witch’s _A Forest_ is a nice example of the genre as it mixes traditional horror track characteristics, like lower bass tones, with a repeated beat and lyrics. It is admittedly more atmospheric and less spooky than other tracks.
Tess’s _Fractional_ features more abrasive sounds and sometimes sounds like a steam kettle trying to summon a demon.
Sidewalks and Skeletons’ _Sleep Paralysis_ has a heavy bass track and a lot of background tones. The music video also has a lot of spooky stuff in the background. 

**Lower Case**

Lower Case is much harder to find than Witch House as it is a lot more… niche. It’s spooky, but more minimalist and almost Lovecraft-ian. It’s almost a little difficult to sit through a whole song as they kept me a little on edge seemingly waiting for a jump scare though none of them ever seem to arrive.
Steve Roden’s _Airria (Hanging Garden)_ is a good example of the genre because it features low, rolling bass tracks and tonal singing that is concerning.
Ryoji Ikeda’s _Data Matrix_ is another minimalist work, though it includes much higher frequencies. It has a digital theme and beeps between bass tones keep the time. Further textures come and go throughout the song, and do the brunt of development during _Data Matrix’s_ ten minute run time.

**Danger**

I can’t review Danger Music very well because I can’t find more than two tracks. However, it’s also the most scary genre of music, so I had to include it in this list. Danger music fits a niche group of listeners that caters more to masochistic and experimental genres. I say this because Danger Music requires either the audience or the performer (or both) to get hurt during the production of a song. It can only be played live to truly be Danger Music
Personally, I think there’s a chance that the Danger Music scene isn’t really as big as some media outlets make it out to be. The only references I can find to it are in top ten lists on indie music sites that like to reference Dick Higgins, one artist who became popular due his performances in the sixties which criticized the Vietnam war (Bradford Bailey). Even the Wikipedia page for the genre is surprisingly sparse with only few examples of live performances of any type surviving in memory least of all on film.
Dick Higgins’ “Danger Music #17” was one of the two tracks I could find, and it’s really just a man screaming very loud for a couple minutes. It is very concerning.
Hanatarsh’s live track is another elusive danger music track that survived in video form. The video seems to have been taken with a tripod that is centered on an old CRT TV. The music is muted and of poor quality, and in the foreground there is a man throwing barrels and other assorted objects. Sometimes, he dives into them. It should also be noted that the clip is only three minutes long.
