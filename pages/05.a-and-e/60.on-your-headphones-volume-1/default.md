Pink Sweat$ seems to have magically appeared in the music scene only this past summer when he uploaded his song “Honesty” to SoundCloud, which had him accumulate over 3,000 listeners in just a matter of months. This completely new face has no past projects that can be found and only recently decided to start up his social media platforms. Yet, he released a six-track EP in early November that digorges a mixture of The Weeknd’s vocals and Drake’s feels. In other words, if you were looking for a few songs to cry to, this EP is it.

Volume 1 starts with “Honesty,” where Pink Sweat$ comforts his love interest who’s afraid of being vulnerable in a relationship. The simple but soulful guitar in the song’s instrumentation is what caught my attention when it came on shuffle while I was at a buddy’s house. As soon as the chorus came to step on my neck with effortless falsetto, to say that I became dissociated and delved into my own feelings in that moment is an understatement. The next song, “Call Me,” continues with similar tablatures but this time with a slower tempo. Pink Sweat$ admits to the girl that he had a close encounter with that he’s been reminiscing her and this track happens to be my personal favorite on the EP.

As of now, Pink Sweat$ currently has only one music video for the tracks on his EP, besides the one for “Honesty” that was released last September. “Drama” has a much more cheery vibe with a happy-tuned acoustic instrumental. The music video wholeheartedly delivers the message of the lyrics in a sweetly innocent plot that follows a nerdy character who feels socially excluded but then drinks a potion that was offered by an animated pink bird and wakes up as a “young man doing boss things.” The EP then moves forth with “Would You,” which didn’t quite pique my favor. I feel that this song has a generic pop melody that you hear on the radio. In that sense, I feel like I’m listening to commercial music.

In the most mellow track and possibly the saddest, “Cocaine” is where Pink Sweat$ talks about his love interest falling for the wrong people. He tells her not to trust anybody since she had “traded emotions in for cocaine.” This is what you play when you’re laying in bed staring at your ceiling in the darkness at 4 a.m pretending to be in a dramatic music video.

“No Replacing You” is the last song of the EP. Again, the melody in this one is nothing different from many of the pop acoustic songs that doesn’t have much ear candy going on. I think that with what Pink Sweat$ currently has in store for neo-soul and R&B in songs like “Honesty,” he’s able to get the recognition he deserves. All in all, I’m looking forth to future music to be released.
