On Wednesday, Sept. 30, Daniel Arzola was kind enough to grace UMM with his presence by hosting a workshop on “artivism.” Students were asked to RSVP via Google Forms, and attendees were either at Turtle Mountain Cafe or attending via Zoom.

Arzola is a digital artist and activist who has been creating LGBT+ motivational work since 2013. He has been recognized as creating the first viral LGBT+ campaign in Venezuela. His work has been translated into twenty different languages, and he has been a guest speaker at universities across the United States.

At the beginning of the event, Arzola wanted to preface his workshop by saying, 
“I never studied English. I learned English by playing Nintendo and watching 
movies and TV shows. For me, when I need to explain things in English, it can be 
difficult. I always tell people: when I have to explain something in Spanish, I feel 
like Superman, but when I have to explain something in English, I just feel like 
Clark Kent. Please bear with me.”

Arzola is from Venezuela and he defines his work as artivism.  
“Some people define our work as being a combination of art and activism. I believe that artivism is to intervene in the dynamics that we use to communicate: to create a message that allows us to express an idea but above all, an idea that transcends, that invites us to share knowledge as a community. I believe that art allows us to talk about who we are and where we came from. This is what I do.”

He published a collection of pieces in 2013 online, titled No Hoy Su Chiste, which roughly translates to “I Am Not A Joke”. Each of these pieces is a poster featuring colorful artwork and a statement against transphobia and homophobia. According to Arzola, it was and is still common for LGBT+ peoples in Venezuela to be viewed as a joke, as a laughingstock. When asked how he felt about this, Arzola responded, “I think mockery is a seed of violence.” He personally went through a number of non-violent and violent altercations in Venezuela, which led to him feeling that there needed to be more conversations about the severity of the injustices in his country, as well as globally.
This project began on the internet, but today, Arzola’s pieces have been broadcasted across different mediums, spurring conversations across the globe. 

After giving a brief introduction on his background and his previous works, Arzola began leading some drawing exercises. First, he asked everyone to draw a cat, but he added that we should not be hesitant to draw, even though some of us have not created art for several years. 

“I think that everybody used to draw, when we were kids. Then, one day, we stopped drawing because someone at some point said ‘Hmm, I don’t think that looks like a cat. I don’t think that looks like a person,’ and we stopped drawing. The people who don’t stop drawing are artists but everyone used to draw when we were kids so we are going to draw again today. The aesthetic result doesn’t matter. This is a free space, a safe space, so everyone is going to draw today. This is an exercise about the basic process of art, when thinking of art as a process of communication.”

While we were working on this exercise, Arzola encouraged us to go all out with our drawing, to express ourselves without getting nervous about getting the anatomy or the textures correct. He also encouraged us to share our cats.
“There are a lot of people, when you see artwork by very famous artists, you can realize that you don’t need to be the best person drawing or have the most beautiful voice: you only need to learn how to transmit a message with the tools that you have. In this moment, that message is only a cat.”

After a few minutes, people held up their cats on the Zoom call (as well as in Turtle Mountain Cafe), and we were all congratulated for completing the exercise. 

We were then asked to complete a drawing of the Mona Lisa, with our own personal take on the world-renowned piece, with a piece of our own story.
“Sometimes, when we can intervene in the process of art, we can focus more of the message than on the media. The Mona Lisa is so easy to intervene because everyone agrees that it is art, so when you put a message on it, you can recognize instantly that it is important, and that it is art. What is art? Throughout the story of humanity, the concept of art has been defined by many people—philosophers, scientists, and of course, those who make art—artists.”

At the end of both exercises, I personally felt more connected to the rest of the participants. We were all vulnerable, letting our guards down, drawing without a care in the world. That, Arzola explained, is the basis for creating unity, for spreading a thick layer of understanding across our discorded world.

“Sometimes it is very difficult to be an artist because, at least in Latin America, people do not take art seriously as a profession until they need an artist to create something.[...] When I was a kid, people used to destroy my illustrations a lot. This is why I decided to do digital illustrations – if someone destroys one of my posters, they are only destroying the medium, but they cannot destroy the meaning, because it lives on digital. Art can be fragile when we do not give it a platform. I also think that it is very important that when we create something, to try to put it on the internet. There will be someone who likes it, someone who looks at your art and thinks, ‘Oh, that’s the way that I feel.’ Art has the power to connect.”
