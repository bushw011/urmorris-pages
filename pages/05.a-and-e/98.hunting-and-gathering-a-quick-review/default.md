The University of Minnesota Morris Theatre Arts Discipline presents: “Hunting and Gathering,” February 20–22. A critically acclaimed romantic comedy by Brooke Berman, “Hunting and Gathering” explores urban rootlessness and the search for connections—physical and emotional—through four dynamic characters living in New York City.

The production is directed by Associate Professor of Theatre Arts, Siobhan Bremer. Bremer describes Hunting and Gathering as a “comedy with a point.” She hopes audiences understand its message that home isn’t necessarily a tangible place. “To me, home is people and family. We find peace in life when we find people we can trust and people who let us be ourselves no matter what.”

The cast includes Emily Kjenaas ‘22 as Ruth, rudderless in her attempt to secure a stable home and partner. Cameron Shultz ‘23 plays a couch-surfing Buddhist and friend to Ruth. Derek Johnson ‘23 plays Jesse and Tess Walker ‘22 plays Bess, lovers in a short-lived affair. Aaron Otten ‘21 and Destiney Lopez ‘23 were understudies. 

Performances of “Hunting and Gathering” ran Thursday, February 20, through Saturday, February 22, at 7:30 p.m., with a 2 p.m. matinee on Saturday, in the Humanities Fine Arts Black Box Theatre. The show ran an hour and 20 minutes without an intermission, and included mature content. “Hunting and Gathering” features themes of love, loss, homesickness, and heartbreak. Utilizing a simple stage of modest furniture and cardboard boxes, the audience is welcomed into a series of different apartments with similar struggles.

Ruth is the tough woman trying to move past the memories of her ex-husband while keeping in touch with her closest friend, Astor, a couch-surfer with a laidback mindset and coincidentally, her ex-husband’s brother. 

On the other side, there is Jesse, Astor’s brother and a professor at Columbia University who is going through the motions. Jesse is simply teaching and working to find a new apartment when an affair suddenly comes into play, and things become complicated.

Although a short, simple play, “Hunting and Gathering” touches on issues with co-living, with leaving home, getting past a strong relationship, and the hardship of maintaining a calm head. Rent aside, there are a plethora of problems that the youth of today have to face, and this play had a clever way of portraying both the external and internal issues with living on your own and navigating adulthood.
