Does anyone remember “I Prevail”, the famous “pop goes punk” band that covered Taylor Swift’s “Blank Space” in  2013? Yeah, they’ve been busy making some sweet tracks over the past few years, and their newest album takes the cake. Trauma, which was released on March 29, 2019, is the band’s sophomore full-length album that features a mix of heavy metal and raw emotions. The album was created after lead singer, Brian Burkheiser, suffered from a vocal injury and developed a polyp in his throat during the band’s 2017 tour. He then proceeded to get it examined, and later, surgically removed. Why do you have to know all of this? The album we are talking about deals with a lot of heavy subjects, from depression to on-and-off relationships, and just feeling disconnected from society. Brian and his team put their all into making a passionate, angsty representation of their struggle for the past couple of years, all prepped for the audience’s ears. The album has a good combination of ballads and traditional “I Prevail,” along with some experimental tracks like “Paranoid” and “Goodbye.” While half of the album sounds softer than what you would expect, they hit the feels instantaneously, making up for their ballads with “Bow Down” and “Deadweight.” If you listened to “I Prevail” in the past, I recommend giving Trauma a chance. If you have not listened to “I Prevail” in the past, you are missing out, my friend. Huge disclaimer: If you are easily disturbed by mentions of depression, paranoia, and self-harm, maybe just listen to the Taylor Swift cover.
