The 2017/2018 Womenâ€™s Basketball season is wrapping up. At the time of publishing, the team is 13-12 and playing at Bethany Lutheran College in Mankato for a chance to continue in the UMAC Tournament. Coach Tim Grove took time on February 19 to answer some questions about the season and the team.

_What do you like about coaching here in Morris? _

This is my 12th season as head coach at UMM.  The thing I like most about coaching at Morris is the quality of student-athlete we get to work with.  We get great kids in our program from great families who really care about getting a top-notch education and play the game of basketball because they have a passion for it.  They care about one another and work hard to be successful.

_How has this 2017/2018 season been for the team?_

We really got off to a rough start this season due to the incredibly difficult non-conference schedule we put together.  We started the season 0-7, but the players did a great job keeping those losses in perspective.  We have bounced back from that start to have a very good UMAC season.

_What are some recent highlights? Overall season highlights?_

As for recent highlights, we closed the regular season with an 8-game winning streak.  It has been a great team effort as we have a lot of players contributing to our success.  It has been a total team effort.  We finished conference play with a 12-4 record, which tied us for 2nd place.

_How is this season wrapping up? _

With the regular season complete, we set our sights on the UMAC Tournament.  This Wednesday night we travel to Mankato to play Bethany Lutheran.  BLC was also 12-4 in conference play and we split the two games we played with them this season.  We are expecting another great game Wednesday night.

_Is there anything else you would like to say about this season and/or Cougar Basketball in general?_

I'm very proud of how our players represent our program on and off the court.  Nine of our eleven players had GPAs of 3.5 or higher for Fall Semester.  They truly care about getting a great education by keeping basketball in its proper perspective.
