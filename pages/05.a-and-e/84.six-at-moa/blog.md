The cast of “SIX” recently held a promotional event at the Mall of America on Sunday, October 27, from 1 to 2 p.m.

What is “SIX,” you ask? Only the most important production in the world, capturing buzz across the globe.

The musical captures the inside story on the six wives of the infamous King Henry VIII, with a modern twist. The musical was written by two recent Cambridge graduates, Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, back in their senior year. The musical took of almost overnight, and the main cast -- Adrianna Hicks as Catherine of Aragon, Andrea Macasaet as Anne Boleyn, Abby Mueller as Jane Seymour, Brittney Mack as Anna of Cleves, Samantha Pauly as Katherine Howard, and Anna Uzele as Catherine Parr -- have shed new light on 50 years of historical neglect on the shadows of their maniacal spouse.

The rotunda was bustling with audience members and cameras clicking before the queens had set a single foot on stage. A brief introduction by a host of KDWB Radio Station, and the lights came on. The stage was suddenly electric. Te song started, and the queens introduced themselves, each one clamoring for the spotlight, donning spiked dresses and vicious attitudes. Every wife had their own distinct style, although all six had well-synchronized movement from time to time, going in and out of formation throughout their routine. Every line seemed to earn a holler of joy from the audience, and the actresses were grinning from ear to ear as the song ended, and the crowd cheered. No bars were held and no breath was wasted. The modern twist to the play helps bring each queen to a level of relatability with their target age group, making various references to social media and using typical twenty-frst century jargon. The show was indescribable, with the level of energy on stage and the breathtaking power of six women dominating the air around them with the stories of their lives, up until their last breath. 

SIX at MOA Te performances were short, the event was over in the blink of an eye, but the “SIX” queens had a few words of advice to their fans: 

• Enjoy the process and love yourself through it.

• Shine a light and be that light for someone; support one another.

• Cheesy but true, just be yourself because everyone else is taken.

• Yes, it’s hard. Yes, it sucks. Yes, in the moment you want to cry and just throw things but it does get better. When you wake up and take another breath, you live your life. No pressure on living life, just do it.

• Don’t ever apologize for who you are and don’t ever try to make yourself smaller to accommodate how people are feeling. Reach as far as you can. Fill the space, because if people don’t like it, they can get out of the way.

• There’s always a place for you in the stage. Every tiny, detailed, complex, beautiful piece of who you are can be celebrated here.
