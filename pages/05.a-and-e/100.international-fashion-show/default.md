On Thursday, February 21, UMM held the tenth annual International Fashion Show, put together by Black Student Union, International Student Association, and United Students of Africa. 

The show started at 6 p.m. and ended at 7:30 p.m. The event was free to the public. Adeolu Atolani and Brianca Smith-Austin hosted. The tradition of holding an International Fashion Show started ten years ago, when six women came together and proposed that the school host a fashion show that represented the wide variety of different cultures on campus. The international fashion show is held every year for students to showcase their heritage through clothing and dance, with occasional musical performances.

This year, the show included dance, modeling, and a vocal performance by Elena Lam, President of ISA. At the beginning of the show, there was a group dance performance.

The board of BSU introduced themselves, and after a brief introduction by the hosts, the fashion show began.

Models represented every corner of the globe, from Germany to Korea, Mexico to Russia.

There were two waves of models walking down the Edson stage. After the first wave, Elena Lam and her friend, Kathleen, performed two songs, “Can’t Help Falling in Love” by Elvis Presley, as well as a Vietnamese song. 

After a brief, five-minute intermission, there was a short dance competition held by Brianca, with two students winning Dining Dollar gift cards. After the second wave of models, there was one more group performance, followed by a group bow and closing remarks for the event.

Adeolu Atolani, a Biochemistry (Pre med) major and Treasurer for USA (United Students of Africa), walks us through the preparations for the event, as well as what hosting the fashion show meant to him. 

**How long did it take to prepare all of the resources and choreography for the event?**

It took us about a month to prepare the choreography and setting of the event.

**What cultures were you representing?**

The outfit that I wore in the first wave of the fashion show was the same clothing that I wore during my cultural hour on February 16. The outfit that I wore is called a buba (the top) and shokoto (the pants) which come from Nigeria in the Yoruba land. The beads that I wore with it were given to me, as I am the first grandson of my maternal grandpa, who is royalty. Representing my culture as a Nigerian man means everything to me, as it is a significant part of what makes me, me.

What does this event mean to you? What do you think this event should mean to the campus community?

The international fashion show embodies the very meaning of diversity and community that this campus portrays. It’s an opportunity to bring divided cultures together as one for a period of time that has historical significance and value.
