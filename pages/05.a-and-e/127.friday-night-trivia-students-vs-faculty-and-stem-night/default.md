On Friday, Feb. 26, UMM held a students versus faculty trivia night. Trivia night was hosted by Peter Bremer and sponsored by College Bowl. Carolyn Curtis was our reader for the night, and quickly explained the rules. There were multiple rounds, each with their own designated set of categories. First person to buzz in could give their answer, Jeopardy style, but if they got an answer incorrect (or only partially correct) then the other teams got a chance to steal.

Last year, the students lost so they got to pick the first category of the first round. Curtis read out the categories, which included: Brooklyn ‘99, Christmas Movies, and Artists in Europe.
We all learned a vast amount during the course of trivia night. For example, the act of offering hush money is bribing, a fact that many may be familiar with as a result of watching many fast-paced action movies in their youth.
Stephen Crabtree was on a roll until a question was stolen by a student, and from there, the tide surely started to shift in our favor. There were also a myriad of mishaps from hosting over Zoom versus in-person. For instance, when listening to the categories available to him, Crabtree thought that he had heard Werewolves instead of Wearable Tech. Quite frankly, I think people would have enjoyed werewolf trivia.
One question that really stumped people was what foundation that started from a Pennsylvania school started to permit female players in 1950. From the NBA to YMCA (people were really stumped), the answer was Little League!
At the end of the first round, the faculty were clearly in the lead. The second round included categories such as: History of Flight, Hit Songs of The 1960’s, Six Syllable Words. With every question, students were slowly inching up towards the faculty, ready to take them down. 
The rest of the trivia questions followed in a similar fashion, round after round, until the final jeopardy, which was absolutely floored. 
If you’re interested in College Bowl, they meet Mondays through Thursdays from 7 to 9 p.m. in the Humanities Building, Room 11.

On the following Friday, March 5, oSTEM and Briggs Library hosted STEM Trivia Night via Zoom from 7 to 9 p.m. The event was open to anyone and had no fee. Naomi Skulan hosted, along with some members of the oSTEM group at UMM. There were six rounds, with six questions per round. Participants were able to submit their responses via a Google Form that was provided by the organizers. 
The first round was Chemistry, and the round went by fairly quickly. The questions ranged from definitions and concepts, to knowledge of the periodic table of elements.
The second round was Biology, with questions ranging from “What is the powerhouse of the cell,” a crowd favorite, to asking the name of the woman who created the first X-ray photo of DNA without being formally recognized with a Nobel Prize. Fun fact: she was not formally recognized because she had died of ovarian cancer four years prior to the Nobel Prize nominations for 1962 and they did not award Nobel prizes to deceased candidates.
The rest of the rounds were Math and Statistics, Geology, Physics, and Queer STEM History. Emily Wittkop also hosted a couple of the rounds, and gave out some interesting tidbits during the Queer STEM History round. 
From Fibonacci to Sir Francis Bacon, the participants trudged on towards the final question:
In what year was the first adding machine (an early form of a calculator) created? This adding machine was known as the Pascaline. Although the tiebreaker question was not necessary to determine the winning team, contestants gave it a shot and the answer was 1644!
All in all, trivia Fridays were a lot of fun, and both College Bowl and oSTEM were thrilled by the number of participants. Keep an eye out for more information on upcoming events!
