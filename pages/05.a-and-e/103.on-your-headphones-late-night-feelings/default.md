At work, in the shower, and on the move I have been listening to Mark Ronson’s recent album, “Late Night Feelings.” While this album may not be as new as some of the things others may be listening to, I’ve had it on repeat most days for the past several months since its release.

This album came out in June of 2019, so it is certainly newer than most of the music I listen to. (I like to describe my taste, other than this album, as BBQ dad music. It’s not great, I know.) I learned about this album while listening to NPR, actually, when they were interviewing Mark Ronson about the process of writing this album. (That interview itself is fascinating, and a very emotional story, so I would recommend that people who may be interested go and look that up.)

This album features a different female artist for nearly each song. (I say “nearly” because there are a few repeats.) While popular artists like Miley Cyrus, Alicia Keys, and Camila Cabello have songs on this album, many of the songs are performed by artists I had never heard of before. A quick search online showed me that some of these singers have contracts through Mark Ronson, who has at least a small part in writing their other music. This doesn’t surprise me too much; Mark Ronson was behind a lot of Amy Winehouse and Lady Gaga’s songs, as well as bops like “Uptown Funk.” We all loved that song, right? This album introduced me to some of my new favorite artists, though, specifically King Princess and Yebba.\

I would 110% recommend this album to my friends, family, and even strangers. Regardless of your mood or your taste in music, this album seems to have something for everyone. Seriously, this is the kind of album that you can shuffle through and just jam out to. I think this may be the first time that I’ve given out this score, but I give this album an A++.
