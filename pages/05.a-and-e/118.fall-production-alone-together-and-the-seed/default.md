From Thursday, October 22 to Sunday, October 25, the Morris Theatre Discipline streamed their fall production, Alone, Together & The Seed, on YouTube. The Morris Theatre Discipline released a promotional video on their YouTube channel on September 29.

Director's Note:
Siobhan Bremer, Director and University of Minnesota Morris Associate Professor of Theatre, teamed up with Aaron Otten, Assistant Director and together they selected seven short scripts from the original production Alone, Together and paired it with an adaptation from The Seed by Britney Walker-Merritte to create an hour-long virtual production providing vibrant opportunities for theatre students during the challenging time when an in-person production was deemed unsafe due to the pandemic.

Alone, Together was created by The UC Santa Barbara’s LAUNCH PAD Artistic Director Risa Brainin and Professor Annie Torsiglieri, who commissioned distinguished playwrights with the prompt Alone, Together. Playwrights contributed 39 short plays and monologues written to be performed via Zoom.
In one hour, 11 student actors from UMM will perform eight well written short pieces that follow the shock, reactions and how to cope during the pandemic. This is provided free of charge but we ask that you pay what you can to help cover our production costs. Streaming available Oct 22-25, 2020.

Each play was filmed using webcams, in order to deliver quality productions while implementing safe measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students were directed on how to arrange the items in their rooms while filming, as well as how to control lighting. The result was surprisingly well done, as the students filmed themselves on Zoom, the video calling system that we have all been subjected to use during these trying times. The familiar clicks and beeps, the grainy images, everything felt more personal this way. The scripts were very emotional, ranging from topics such as family and belonging, to discussing the plight of those whose work was directly affected by the pandemic, struggling to find work, to coping with severe depression during an already depressing year. 

My personal favorite was the first play, “Talk Tomorrow”. The obvious tension between the two siblings was beautifully captured by their body language and microexpressions, with the air in between the calls so thick, one would need a hefty knife to make any impact. In the beginning, there seems to be no progress in their conversation, until the first voice crack is heard, and although the video quality is questionable, we can assume that some tears were shed.

I have included the list of each play and monologue, along with the students involved. Although this production was only available on YouTube for a three-day span, I strongly encourage you to visit their crowdfunding site and donate what you are able.

Zoe Johnson started the campaign in order to support the Theatre discipline at the University of Minnesota Morris. As the saying goes: the show must go on.
