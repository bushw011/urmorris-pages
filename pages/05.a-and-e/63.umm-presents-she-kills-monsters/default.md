Morris was transported to the world of Dungeons and Dragons in the latest of the UMM student productions, with a special rendition of Qui Nguyen’s She Kills Monsters. The show cost $5 per student and was approximately two hours long with a 15-minute intermission. This one-act play delved into the world of Dungeons and Dragons, as a young woman is thrown into a popular roleplaying game in order to unravel the mysteries of her late sister. 

Set in 1995 Athens, Ohio, the main character Agnes (played by Natalie Wallraff) struggles with the loss of her teenage sister Tilly (played by Megan Steblay). Upon discovering one of her late sister’s old notebooks, Agnes seeks out a student named Chuck (played by Sam Madden), who quickly recognizes the book as a Dungeons and Dragons custom-made game scenario. This simple one-act play ventured across the lands of Tilly’s homeworld, revealing some of the struggles of high school students that her sister, Agnes, may not have recognized in her younger days. 

The play had a strong message about fitting in and placing more importance on discovering oneself, including the struggles of hiding one’s sexuality, being a student with disabilities, and lacking confidence to speak up. The actors got very up-close and personal with the audience, and the crew did a wonderful job with the dramatic lighting and sound effects. 

Sam Madden, one of the main actors of the play, had a few words to say about his experience with being in the production. 

“When I heard about the play, I had never actually been in theatre before. My strongest connection to the play was that I had been playing Dungeons and Dragons for the past two years, and was already a pretty big fan of the play. To be completely honest, when I first read through the script I wasn’t a big fan of it. But now, after spending time with it and seeing it actually performed, I like it a lot more.” 

When asked about the nature of his character, Chuck, Sam responded, “He’s a complicated character. He comes of as a real jerk, which he kind of is, but he also has moments where he genuinely cares about Agnes and her well-being. All in all, he’s a typical high school boy with a lot of growing up to do, but is making steps in the right direction.” 

The play is Morris’ second production of the three planned for the year. Look out for the next (and last) UMM student production of the school year, Wizard of Oz, coming in April!
