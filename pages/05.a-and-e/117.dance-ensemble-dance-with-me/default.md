This year, Dance Ensemble held their fall show, titled “Dance With Me”, through two delivery methods: in-person showings on Friday, Oct. 24 and Saturday, Oct. 25 and a posted livestream on YouTube which was live streamed on Friday, Oct. 24. All of the delivery methods for the show were free to the public, and the performance is still available for viewing on YouTube.

Dance Ensemble seemed to follow some sort of storyline, leading the audience on a journey. The evening started off with high energy music, with a group performance of “Dance” by DNCE, choreographed by the ensemble. Suddenly, there is a shift to “Make Me Feel” by Janelle Monae, and the metaphorical masks come off as the dancers’ movements become unbelievably fluid. Staying on the theme of feel-good music, the next dance featured “It’s Tricky” by Run DMC. Body rolling and a bit of sass, the evening continued to impress as the socially distanced dance crews kept us thoroughly entertained. 

However, the mood seemed to change with the next song, and the overall theme shifted towards something more intimate, more heartbreaking. Dancing to “Older” by Ben Platt, the slow swirling and twirling of the synchronized dancers remind us that life is short, and to not “let your wonder turn into closure”, as the lyrics state. One somber song behind us, we hold our tears as the mood is slightly lifted by “Someone To You” by Banners. The rest of the performance follows a similar pattern, with high-energy songs followed by soothing, slow-moving ballads. With Passenger, Hozier, and Parson James, the audience listened and responded with phone lights shimmering in the bleachers. 

Our hearts and minds were in sync with the music, as the performers expressed joy, fear, confusion, and anger through this hour of intense storytelling. The clever imagery painted through the choreography felt more intentional than in previous performances, perhaps due to an ability to display typical formations. Every arm raised was in unison, every body responding to the others, it was truly poetry in motion.

Below, I have included the list of performances in order, as well as the choreographers involved. Once again, the performance is still available on YouTube so I highly encourage you all to view it if you were unable to attend any of their showings in October. The hope is that more and more events become available online, for us to enjoy throughout this hectic year.
