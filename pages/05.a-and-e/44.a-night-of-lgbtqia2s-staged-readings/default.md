Friday, April 6 treated students to A Night of LGBTQIA2S+ Staged Readings. This event was held by Meiningens Student Theatre, in conjunction with the UMM Theatre Discipline in general. Two plays were shown, both originally used for the first annual LGBT Play-in-a-Day, which took place the year before. What made this night unique, however, was that the second play, _John Hughes Wrote my Diary_, had been reworked, revised, and expanded by Paige Quinlivan. 

The first play, _Life on Mars_, was written by Terese McCauley and directed by Sally Bremer. This tragic story of regrets, reconciliation, and missed opportunities played upon the idea of waiting out the last moments before the end of the world. Though this play depicted the last words and confessions of a group of friends, it was far from cliché, and managed to deeply investigate each character in a short period of time. What made this play powerful was each character’s own analysis of their life, especially for Camille (Quinlivan), and Steffie (Victoria Evans). These two characters come together to work through the fine line between their friendship and infatuation. At the very end, just as the world was supposed to end, the two moons (Shane McKinley and Spencer Hammerstein) switched from repeating the word “death” to “rebirth,” giving a chillingly beautiful twist to such a bittersweet story.

The second play, _John Hughes Wrote my Diary_ began as a 15 minute vignette, but was later developed into Quinlivan’s first full play. As with Quinlivan’s piece for this year’s Play-in-a-Day, _Moon River_ the incorporation of music and strong grounding within a specific time period played a large role in perfecting this play. For this play, however, we witnessed references to the 1980s, despite it being set in the present. Through the use of the diary and internal monologue of the main character, played by Bailey Soika, the audience got to experience the awkwardness of high school and the loneliness of the overactive imagination of a teenager. Around the middle of the play came the mixup in which the two best friends, Tommy (Evan Aanerud) and Marty (Soika), realize that they are both queer. At first, this is a heartwarming moment depicted by an ‘80s-style montage, which worked surprisingly well for a staged format. The conflict between the friends, however, led to drawn-out suspense for the audience.

This play upended the tropes of 1980s found-family and coming of age movies, giving us the queer love story we hadn’t realized we needed. The characters all went through clear development, and were easy to relate to, from Marty’s numbness to Tommy’s highly self-aware monologue about feeling like he was not even the main character in his own life. What started as a quickly-written play performed just once last year became so much more, and displayed Quinlivan’s great talent with writing, along with the adaptability of all the actors involved. It is this writer’s hope that other works from the LGBT Play-In-A-Day be expanded as this was, creating brilliant queer pieces of art.
