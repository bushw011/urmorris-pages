Jazz at the Library was a two-part program taking place at the Morris Public Library on Tuesday, November 6 from 6:00-7:30 p.m. The first segment, running from 6-6:30 p.m, consisted of an all-age presentation titled "What is Jazz?" followed by an hour-long performance by UMM's Jazz Ensemble I. 

"What is Jazz?" began with a combo performance of the standard jazz tune "All Blues" by Miles Davis. The combo (a term used to signify a small-group jazz ensemble as opposed to a big band) consisted of UMM students Christian Pfeiffer on tenor sax, Roen Aronson on alto sax, Annika Paulson on bass, Justin Martin on drums, and Dr. Campbell on keyboard. Following their brief performance, Dr. Campbell and the student performers took turns describing their various musical roles to the audience, performing examples on their instruments to better illustrate their points. 

Pfeiffer and Aronson explained that the horn players in a combo (most often saxophonists, trumpeters, and trombonists in jazz) are traditionally responsible for playing the "head," or melody, of a tune to begin and end a piece. These melodic instruments may play the head in unison or in harmony and some tunes, such as the one they performed, may even contain a counter melody to be played alongside the first. From there, Dr. Campbell explained his role as a chord player to be one of providing harmonic support for the ensemble; he explained that his role is one laden with decision making in that he has a multitude of options for voicing any particular chord he plays. Last but not least, Paulson and Martin explained their joint role of "conducting the train," or keeping time for the ensemble, most often through maintaining a steady quarter note pulse between them.

From there, Dr. Campbell showed the audience the wide array of musical possibilities the genre of jazz provides. Because so much of jazz is improvised rather than written down, he explained, players are free to express a variety of styles and emotions in their playing. To illustrate this, he had the student quintet improvise an "angry-sounding" chorus of a blues, followed by a "sad-sounding" chorus. 

To round out the first segment, Dr. Campbell invited a child volunteer from the audience to improvise on a blues in A minorâ€”a musical key that lends itself well to soloing with only the white keys of a piano. The volunteer, a student from Morris Area Elementary, spent two choruses soloing with the student combo, for which she received a sturdy round of applause from the audience.

The second half of the program consisted of the UMM Jazz Ensemble performing "charts," or big band arrangements, from their upcoming regional tour and concert. These tunes included the Milt Jackson standard "Bags' Groove," the Count Basie classics "Blues in Hoss' Flat" and "Hay Burner," a John Clayton arrangement of Horace Silver's boogaloo "The Jody Grind," Thad Jones' 16-bar blues "Big Dipper," and David Springfield's "A Little Peace," performed by the ensemble as a slow ballad. Student soloists during this half of the program included again students Pfeiffer, Aronson, Dr. Campbell, and Martin, as well as trombonists Cain Whelan and Ellis Weglewski and trumpeters Shawn Strom, Levi Jahnke, and Marcus Demers.

Dr. Campbell concluded the program with an invitation to UMM Jazz's upcoming concert on Friday, November 30 at 7:30 p.m. in UMM's Humanities Fine Arts Recital Hall. This concert will be significant, in that it will feature the return of UMM's Jazz Ensemble II, an ensemble open to students and community members alike this year.
