On Sunday, January 21, Lindsay Schlemmer, a cello and bass performer and teacher, performed her faculty recital accompanied by Alison Lee on piano. This program featured three sensational pieces by Zoltan Kodaly, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Frederic Chopin. Lindsey Schlemmer is a talented and active performer who has worked with a variety of groups and as a solo performer. In addition to performing, she teaches private lessons for musicians of any age or skill level and is a teaching specialist here at the University of Minnesota, Morris. Schlemmer’s accompanist, Alison Lee, has been playing piano from the age of five and has performed in many different music festivals. Her passion for collaborating with other musicians has made her a highly talented duo pianist. The two worked well together and it was clear that their good control over the balance of each piece added significantly to how well the performance was able to invoke emotion from the audience.

Schlemmer started her recital with a slow, deeply expressional piece, “Adagio” by Hungarian musician Zoltan Kodaly (1882-1976). Kodaly’s musical pieces are known for both being strongly influenced by Hungarian folksongs and Western classical music. This work, originally published in 1910, only has one movement. Despite having just one movement, there was plenty of emotion expressed in this gentle piece. 

The second composition chosen changed the pace of the recital. This piece was Beethoven’s “Sonata in A Major, Op. 69.” and is one of the five cello sonatas Beethoven wrote throughout his life. All three movements of this song, while complex, were done with precision and attention to detail brought out many of the intricacies of Beethoven’s sonata. This exciting musical piece was captivating to those listening and appeared to be enjoyable to perform for both musicians.

To finish, Schlemmer did a powerful performance of “Sonata in G Minor, Op 65.” by Frederic Chopin (1810-1894). This difficult piece was performed wonderfully as both the cellist and pianist brought out the many changes in harmonies. Interestingly, this was one of the only compositions Chopin wrote that was not primarily for piano, the instrument his work is most known for. This was a strong finale that further accentuated Schlemmer’s talent as a performer, collaborator, and teacher. Though all three pieces were different in mood, tempo, and style, the performance managed to tie them together very smoothly, which made the afternoon recital even more enjoyable for the audience. Overall, the recital clearly demonstrated Schlemmer’s wonderful work as a cellist and her love for music.
