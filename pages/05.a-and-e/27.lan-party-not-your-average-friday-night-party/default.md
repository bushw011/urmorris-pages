The LAN Party, coordinated by the Computer Science Club, is not your typical college party. Running for 15 straight hours from Friday evening to Saturday morning, this long night of gaming attracted students from all different corners of campus. There were 102 participants at this year’s event and there was a good mix of students of different years, though the majority were freshmen.

There were several games set up for any group to use, such as “Dance Dance Revolution”, “Super Smash Brothers,” “Rockband,” and, a recent favorite, the “Jackbox Party Packs,” which is where I spent the majority of my time. As groups of people crowded around these screens, cheering for their favorite fighter or for some ridiculous answer to a trivia question, the energy of everyone in the room began to increase. Even Joe Lauer, who spent the majority of the time there working on his English homework, was excited for the events of the night. “It’s a good way to chill out with friends!” he explained, very positive despite his fight against what was due Monday. Right beside him and on the opposite end of the gaming spectrum was LeeAnne Kovacs, who was extremely proud to have finished “Dragon Age: Origins” in only one night, claiming that it was the the most proactive she has ever been in gaming.

You do not have to be an expert with games or computers to enjoy yourself at the LAN Party, although there were plenty of people there with much more gaming knowledge than me. One such person was Dalton Bliss who took time to explain his gaming setup, the computer he had started working on, and my very unimpressive laptop’s information. He was surprised that I was able to play games like “Skyrim” or “Dragon Age” with such a junky laptop. As Dalton explained it, “The LAN party allows people from different majors and areas of campus to hang out together, doing something they all mutually love or enjoy!”  He was certainly not the only one there with an impressive setup. There was a relatively balanced mix of people with huge monitors playing alongside people who brought laptops or brought nothing and joined in with others. Almost half of the attendees were gaming on a laptop, though an impressive 34% of students did not bring anything of their own. In some cases, joining games with either good friends or people you had not met yet could make the night more fun and memorable than playing a game on your own, though that can also be enjoyable.

The crowd from the LAN party shifted and moved around as time went on. Even I stepped out around 7 for a bit to catch some of Bad Movie Club’s showing of “Sharknado V: Global Swarming” happening right below the LAN party, though the majority of the people there ended up coming upstairs to join the fun once the movie had ended. There was another movement of a group of people when several students headed down to the Moccasin Flower Room to start up some horror games. According to Tori Hang, the student who developed the plan to get a group together to play a horror game, they stayed up until nearly the end of the party finishing the “Misao” horror game. When asked how the game went, Tori commented, “We all got really invested in the story and helped each other with puzzles, which ended up being a real bonding experience.”

Most, if not all, of the participants of the LAN party shared a similar experience to Tori, and found the night perfect for bonding with other students who like gaming. As fun and eventful as this semester’s LAN party was, we can’t wait for the next. Spending hours playing games with friends is, and always will be, a fantastic way to destress from the busy ups and downs of college life.
