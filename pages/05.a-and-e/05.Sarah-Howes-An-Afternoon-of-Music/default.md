This past Sunday the 17th, a recital was presented by music faculty member Sarah Howes, a professor of voice at UMM. The program was accompanied by Rebecca Heyn, a long-time colleague and friend of Howes. The two had worked together previously so the recital on Sunday was a reunion of musical talents. 

Howes has begun her Doctoral work at the Twin Cities campus. In order to advance in her program, she is required to give routine recitals. The Sunday concert featured American and German-American composers and writers. Howes reflected on the text as “memories of life[...]from a woman’s perspective.” 

The program was divided into three pieces. Howes began the concert by singing six movements of _Honey and Rue (1992)_. Each movement varied in style; for example, “The Town Is Lit” was full of diction and vigor. Howes then transitioned into a flowing tune titled “Do You Know Him.” Because the piece was mostly acappella, Howes’ beautiful vibrato was given a soaring tribute. With the last movement, “Take My Mother Home”, Howes displayed a different vocal tone. Accompanied by low, dramatic piano chords, she sang in a jazzy style that demonstrated her vocal flexibility. 

One thing that Howes displayed well was her ability to insert herself emotionally into the context of the piece. Many of these movements had different tones of expression. Whether it was looking throught the audience with frantic eyes, or clutching the piano behind her to signal shock, Howes demonstrated emotion with a mix of facial expressions and movement. 

A personal favorite of the audience was from the second piece, _Seven For Luck (1997)_. The movement, “Chocolate”, was a mix of figurative love language and smirks from Howes. In the text, falling in love is equated to “melting” like chocolate. Other parts of Seven For Luck brought confusion to audience members like me. During the movement “Expecting”, Howes sang a line that incorporated the phrase, “enough of guilt”. When reflecting on the woman’s perspective of the piece, it might be implied that this phrase is signaling the guilt of bearing a child by some women. Still, there is room for interpretation upon closer examination of the text. 

To end her concert, Howes sang a piece titled “Knoxville: Summer of 1915. Op. 24” by Samuel Barber. She described it as “musings on summers as a kid in Knoxville, Tennessee”. Howes’ vocal range is magnificent; she can effortlessly sail through her upper range and easily descend into the dark, rich lower notes. 

With a sigh of contentment and a smile of delight, Howes ended “Knoxville” intently peering through the audience. With the piano slowly diminishing, she stepped back and allowed the mood to set. Howes ended with an air of finality, knowing she had more recitals to give and time to improve her performance.
