In less than two weeks, _Spring Awakening_ will open at the Roger A. Lammers Proscenium theater at UMM. The cast and crew have been working incredibly hard to make a powerful and moving show. 

_Spring Awakening_ is set in late-nineteenth century Germany. The story revolves around a group of adolescents that are faced with a sexual awakening. These characters are eager to have their questions answered about their sexual discoveries. However, society at the time greatly suppresses any thoughts or expressions of sexuality. Through strict and oppressive parents and teachers, these teenagers are left in a world of uncertainty. They then must rebel against their elders in search for answers.

In an interview, Ray Schultz, director of _Spring Awakening_, said “the play is really about wanting to free yourself of the shackles of the previous generation”. When the children are not given the answers they desire, they choose to rebel. “I see the show as about that natural tendency towards rebellion, which the play’s propulsive rock score certainly accentuates.” said Schultz. The shows numbers certainly present mood contrasts. Energetic and flashy songs present the frustration of the adolescents, while mellow and soaring melodies show the more intimate struggles they face. 

Many of the social issues that _Spring Awakening_ highlights are present in the minds of young people today. Struggles of suicide, mental illness, sexual abuse, or questions of sexuality all reflect the immediate and relevant nature of the show. Schultz describes how the show highlights the dangers of ignorance; the censorship of sexuality leads many students to dreadful consequences. “I hope audiences will recognize this danger, not only in terms of how we educate our youth, but even the way we function as a society” said Schultz. 

The production involves an 18-person cast of UMM students; their roles range from students to adults and teachers. Aside from Schutlz directing, many other faculty and students are working on _Spring Awakening_. Vocal director and conductor is Sarah Howes, a vocal teaching specialist at UMM. Stephanie Ferrian acts as the Choreographer for the production. Leading the Scenic and Lighting Design team is Professor Lucas Granholm. Sound Design is led by Justin Anderson. Anne Thorsen is responsible for costuming in the show. The stage management team is headed by Sally Bremer. 

Ariel Crabtree, who plays Marta in the show, commented on how _Spring Awakening_ is important for a college environment: “I think that content of the show is much more relatable to college students. Older and younger generations might have trouble finding themselves in the show. College students have dealt with or continue to deal with the issues present in _Spring Awakening_.” 

Katie Rowles-Perpich plays Wendla, a curious girl that yearns for answers about her sexuality. Rowles-Perpich reflected on the show’s message: “Things don’t change as much as we think they do. We see a juxtaposition between an older society and a more modern one. We see how problems from a long time ago are still large issues today.” To Rowles-Perpich, college students should see _Spring Awakening_ because it shows our lack of development as a society.

Starting Wednesday, November 1st, _Spring Awakening_ at UMM will open to audiences. The show will play Wednesday through Saturday at 7:30 PM, as well as a 2:00 matinee on Saturday. The tickets are $8 for students, $12 for general admission, and $10 for senior citizens. Tables to buy tickets at will be out in the Student Center for the next two weeks. They are also available at 320-589-6274 or at tickets.umn.edu.
