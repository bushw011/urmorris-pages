**By Michael Small, A&E Editor** _originally published in Issue 1, Volume 30 of The University Register on Friday, September 21, 2017_

On Wednesday, August 23rd of 2017, UMM students gathered on the Mall to mourn for a close friend: UMMSTUDENTS@lists.umn.edu, known to friends as simply ListServ. Held by the United Congregation of Meme Team just below the knoll on the mall with steps, the funeral was a somber occasion for most; freshmen attended and had no clue why everyone was so broken up. Whether one remembers the ListServ from previous years or never knew it, it’s worth reflecting on what the ListServ gave to UMM.

The ListServ was always there to promote every voice of UMM. Whether a club wanted to promote an event, someone had a mini-fridge for sale, someone lost their keys for the third time that semester or somebody had an ideological axe to grind with a reply-all during political season, the ListServ was there to promote them all. It likely saw hundreds to thousands of emails advertising open rooms in off-campus homes, and only 34% of them came from like three people last semester alone. Some days saw up to a hundred emails submitted between 8:00am and 4:30pm, but it still toiled away for us all. 

Mourners had much to say. Sydney Bauer, residing minister and Meme Queen of Meme Team said that the ListServ “...meant nonsense and snack updates.” Shafiul Umam said “it meant hours of annoyance, pain, waste of inbox… [Hey dude, what’s that Batman quote about deserving? Just put that down when you write this] it’s the hero Morris deserves, but not the one it needs right now.” Hannah asked “how will I be informed? How will I laugh? Some things were funny.” To Sam Peters, “it meant connection. It meant not only talking to peers but shouting into the void with no response,” and to Caroline Vodacek “it meant freedom of fucking speech, man.”
Students coped with poems and emails, and among other forms of art, memes.

**Title: #ripserv**
We were not friends
Right from the start
You've come to an end
And broken my heart

When we first met,
I must admit true
I was not ready yet
So resolved to quit you

The large sums of mail
I couldn't imbibe
I decided to bail
Sent the word "unsubscribe"

From there, the months passed
The nights -- they grew cold
Without emails amassed
With no lists to behold

My inbox was lonely
My life was off-track
I longed for you only
Then -- you took me back

Since our second meeting
I was not disenchanted
But our time then was fleeting
I took you for granted

Now the future of contact
Is clouded with doubt
No student email list pact
How can we reach out?

Now we find a curve
In the road up ahead
The dear list that had serv'd
Is now gone, r.i.p., ded

So now we all try and cope--
But we just may pull through--
'Cause we still have some hope
In the new Listserv2

-Sam Peters

Roommate Needed. Please.
Live with me, I need someone.
I am so alone.

Lost Purple Mitten
Abandoned in the white snow.
Was it ever found?
 
CREP meets tonight.
Exploiting Freedom of Speech.
Bring your own Taser.
 
A terrible crime.
Gnomes are nowhere to be seen.
Where the fuck are they?
 
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Nah, nah, nah, nah. He-e-ey.
Join listserv2.

After the eulogies and poems, fourteen seconds of silence were observed. Sad music was played as attendants walked a commemorative loop around the Mall. The ListServ’s legacy will live on through ListServ2 (see below), University of MN Morris Forum (see below), the growth of other University listservs, Campus Connections and an explosion of creativity with poster making.

“This facebook group will function as the student listserv functioned in the past, except on facebook. Please join this group and invite your friends so that this page can be a success for all those who want to use it! Post anything from roommate requests and lost and found inquiries to posts promoting events happening in our community.”

Hello everyone!!

Welcome to LISTSERV2. The best underground listserv around! 

We are already growing in members (woo!) but in order for this email list to truly be helpful and effective we will need MORE people to join it.
