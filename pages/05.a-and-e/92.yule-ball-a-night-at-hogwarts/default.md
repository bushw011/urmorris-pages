Students gathered in the Student Center on Saturday, December 14 to celebrate the end of a tough semester, as well as a memorable decade of magical mischief. 2019 marked the tenth anniversary of the Yule Ball tradition on campus, and numerous student organizations involved made sure that the event was truly spectacular with the grand theme: A Night At Hogwarts.

The festivities began at 9 p.m. and ended at 1 a.m. the following morning. Price of admission was $3 per person or $5 for couples. Once inside the Student Center, the long line of young witches and wizards led to the dance area, held in Oyate Hall. There, the DJ spun away as people danced until midnight, when colorful balloons descended and the room erupted in cheer.

Turtle Mountain Cafe was decorated to resemble the Great Hall, with long tables representing each House of the Hogwarts school: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. The area was adorned with tasteful faux tapestry and floating candles. Various refreshments were available, as well as two beautiful cakes, and of course, the fan favorite: butterbeer. Attendees had mixed reactions to the butterbeer, with some relishing in the sickly sweet flavour, with others opting for a cup of water. 

Sweet, savory, and full of frosting, this year’s Yule Ball did not fail to provide excellent snacks for the evening. The festive proceedings continued in Louie’s Lower Level, with student organizations such as Psych Club and PAWS tabling for different exciting activities. From tarots to treasure hunts, the entertainment was endless.

Additionally, there were Harry Potter films being shown in Edson Audirtorium, to relive the memorable moments of the series. There were numerous posters placed in the Student Center in reference to any and all Harry Potter films, as well as the Fantastic Beasts series. As per usual, a photo booth was set up with props and plenty of promising photos were taken.

In the Science Building, 8 Ball the ball python was available for photos. This was very exciting for students, especially those who had attended Yule Ball the previous year, when the snake had not been available for the event. The little snake received plenty of hugs, pats, and boops throughout the night, and seemed content.

Students enjoyed the new take on the tradition, from themes specific to a recent film, to the series in a general sense. Many also appreciated the improvements made to the photo booth, as well as the Fantastic Beasts featured in this year’s treasure hunt. When asked about the significance of Yule Ball on campus, many answered that, similarly to the Star Wars franchise, the love for wizards and wizardry has become generational, being passed down from novel to film, visiting theme parks, and sharing a chocolate frog or two.

Co-chair, Jordyn Meyer, said it best: “Yule Ball is such an amazing and fun tradition! You get one night before finals week to dress up and be stressfree. You can either nerd out with a huge fantasy series, or simply enjoy a night of fancy decorations. It’s also such a huge social gathering for friends both new and old.”
