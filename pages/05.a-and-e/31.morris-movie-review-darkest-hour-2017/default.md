The “Darkest Hour” has reached the high point of the top 10 best war films surrounding World War II ever made. With director Joe Wright behind the project, everyone was ready for another great film that brings out the emotions of the war. The film also came with some of the most superb acting from Gary Oldman who brought Winston Churchill back to life through the screen. The “Darkest Hour” was a gripe taking, emotional film that had you on the edge of your seat.

Wright had setup of high ranking films in his pocket before he started the “Darkest Hour.” With past works of “Pride & Prejudice” (2005) and “Atonement” (2007), Wright deserved the $30 million budget given for the creation of this film. The film ended up with box office earnings of $114.8 million. Along with the high box office income, the “Darkest Hour” received several awards. Gary Oldman alone won the award for Best Actor from the Alliance of Women Film Journalist, Critic’s Choice Movie Awards, Golden Globe, and from AACTA International.

The basis of the “Darkest Hour” was the beginning of Winston Churchill’s time as Prime Minister and how he responded to some of Europe’s darkest times against Nazi Germany. The film follows Churchill as he is given the title of Prime Minister, his opening speech, a few addresses to the people, and his activation of Operation Dynamo to rescue their troops at Dunkirk. Churchill’s lack of a fan base among his peers is shown as he faced challenge after challenge and the pressure to give into peace negotiations with Adolf Hitler. When it feels as if there is no one there Churchill and that he would give to the pressure he is under, you see the people of Great Britain come out. With the scene on the public tube where Churchill talks to some members of the public about the decision he has to make, you see the strength of the people and their willingness to fight for what is right no matter the loses they must face. The revitalization of Churchill’s spirit shines, he addresses the cabinet in the spirit of the people, and launches Operation Dynamo, getting Great Britain through their darkest hour.

Through the film you also see Winston Churchill as a person, not just a Prime Minister. His interactions with his wife Clemmie (Kristin Scott Thomas), and assistant Elizabeth Layton (Lily James) gives the film some of the most human moments from Churchill. By showing the softer side of husband and wife give Churchill a more rounded personality and helps remind Churchill to be softer to the people. His assistant Layton is there for every moment of grief and to be the writer to his words. She helps give little laughs and gripping emotions in her interactions with Churchill.

The “Darkest Hour” is an emotional film that leaves you at the edge of your seat. The reenactment of Great Britain's darkest hour against Nazi Germany is spot on and shows the harsh realities that Winston Churchill underwent in his first days of Prime Minister. Gary Oldman’s acting brought the very best and worst of Winston Churchill’s personality out to create a more human character to relate with. The political drama that comes with a war was a highlight, that though often ignored, was a part of the war all were waiting to see brought to film.
