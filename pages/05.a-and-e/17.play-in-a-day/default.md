Beginning at 9:00 p.m. on the night of Friday, November 10, and ending with a performance at the same time the next day, the Meiningens Student Theatre hold a Play in a Day event in the Edson Auditorium. Play in a Day is an event where students write, direct, and produce plays within 24 hours. Rhiannon Kunesh, Ex-Officio for the student theatre, was present at the two plays Saturday evening. 

The first play, entitled _Fantastic Memes and How to Write Them_, was written by Evan Douville, directed by Maggie Caplan, and performed by Dave Smith, Bailey Soika, Aaron Otten, Katt Bergstrom, and Rachael Knafla. It opens in the middle of a mathematics class just as Mr. Kyle, (Knafla), is assigning homework. Soika’s character, Lacy, instead elects to focus on writing a skit for drama class. She enlists the help of her classmates before embarking on a journey full of silly ideas and countless pop culture references. In the end, the class manages to create a skit where two students go to a drive-in movie theater to see _Star Wars Episode I_. They run into their teacher who turns out to be a closet nerd. He begs the students not to tell his wife. When he returns home, he walks in on his wife watching _Shrek 2_, which Smith’s character Filmore swears is the nerdiest movie of all time. Finally, the two decide to embrace their nerdiness together. 

The journey has a rocky start, however. Initially, the class wants to make a skit titled “Pawn Stars: Shakespeare Edition.” From there, the conversation is derailed several times, with classmate Kris, (Otten), desperately trying to finish his homework before the end of class and Filmore being obsessed with giving a bush a significant role in the skit. As they continue on their journey, they share hate on _The Emoji Movie_ and the _Star Wars_ prequels all while making references to _The Magic School Bus_, _Zoboomafoo_, _Spongebob Squarepants_, and even _Rick and Morty_. A thoughtful interjection is made by Mr. Kyle, during which he highlights the divide between nerd and popular culture. He claims that memes are working to bridge the ever-present gap. In the end, the class leaves, Lacy content with their work, and Mr. Kyle is left to reflect on how he has lost all order in his classroom.

The second and final play of the evening, entitled _Remember That!_ was written by Zach Swigerd, directed by Thomas Pederson, and performed by Katie Booth, Caroline Vodacek, Nolan Pewe, Sam Peters, Hannah Retzer, and Hannah Taylor. The play opens with Sean, (Vodacek), working at a coffee shop. Angela, (Booth), is in a hurry to make it to class on time. She orders a cappuccino that Sean makes and subsequently spills. Angela runs off, unable to wait for him to make another. He makes her a second one anyway and chases after her, delivering her cappuccino while she is in the middle of giving a presentation. They quickly become infatuated with one another. 

The remainder of the play uses reenactments of the initial scene to showcase the emotions of the two lead characters to the audience. It becomes a humorous reflection of a poorly written romance novel when the two are in love and a rude scene with a heartless cashier when Angela learns that Sean cheated on her. In addition, the play uses an intriguing storytelling technique where two related scenes play out on stage at the same time, with one side of the stage relegated to one scene and the other side the other scene. The spotlight, so to speak, shifts from one to the other, effectively showing a scene where Angela is distraught over her breakup with Sean while simultaneously showing Sean regretting his decision to cheat on Angela in the first place. The parallelism is made even more effective by the final shot of the scene: Angela surrounded by supportive friends on one side of the stage and Sean alone in his room on the other. In the end, the two meet at a party and are able to arrive at an understanding, though they inevitably go their separate ways. 

The Meiningens Student Theatre will be hosting two more Play in a Day events next semester, the dates of which are not concrete. Additionally, they are currently working on their next production, _Eurydice_, which will be performed in the spring.
