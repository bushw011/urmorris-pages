Showtime’s top hit _Shameless_ finished off with their season 8 finale on January 28 with almost 2 million viewers. The Showtime original series, an American comedy-drama, started off in early 2011, showing viewers just how crazy life can get. The show is about six kids growing up in Chicago with an alcoholic father. The show presents the struggles that the family goes through to get ahead, though they seemingly always make a mess of things, particularly the father, Frank Gallagher (William Macy).

Season 8 started with an exciting bang, showing Debbie (Emma Kenney) the youngest daughter trying to get her life together by finishing welding school so she can provide a better future for her baby. Also, Ian Gallagher (Cameron Monaghan) finds his calling with his new boyfriend. Ian now in this season tries to help kids who were forced into conversion therapy by starting an LGBT friendly church earning him the name “Gay Jesus.” Frank Gallagher this season was probably the most interesting charter of them all. In Season 8, Frank tries to live an honest life after the death of his wife Monica in season 7. Just when the audience thinks he has changed, he gets laid off of his job. As he tries to find another job, he realizes it is too hard to live a straight life and cooks up a scheme to make easy money. His new schemes are to bring illegal immigrants to Canada and to buy cheap drugs to sell them back into America. Frank is back to being Frank.  His character has to be the most entertaining of all the characters because it is the most unbelievable to think a person could F*%$ up that much but I think thats what makes the show funny in some sick way to see how far off the edge of normal reality they can go. 

I find Lip Gallagher’s (Jeremy White) character this season to be a little boring but heartful. This season he is no longer going to college or succeeding in life but dealing with his alcoholism which he fights in this season as he tries not to become his father. Carl Gallagher, the youngest out of the boys, gets back from military school in the summer and finds out he was kicked out of his scholarship. Now he needs to find a way to come up with the money by the end of the summer. 

The end of the season was okay. Life for the Gallaghers seems to calm down after they give up all their money to pay off the drugs their mom gave them. Lip goes back to school while Frank goes back to drinking. All in all I think that I would rate this new season of _Shameless_ a 7/10. It was interesting but not as much action as there had been in other seasons. I will be waiting with excitement for season 9 which is scheduled to start airing at the end of this year.
