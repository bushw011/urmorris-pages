"Amo" (styled in lowercase) is the sixth studio album from British rock band, Bring Me The Horizon. The album dropped on January 25, 2019 with only a slight delay from the pre-planned January 11 release date. With 13 songs, all of which are written in lowercase except for “Mantra,” which is in all-caps, Bring Me The Horizon has come back with a love album showcasing struggles with commitment between people, as well as within the self. The first song from the album, “Mantra,” was released on August 21, 2018, with an eerie music video and the suggestion of a new album appearing in the coming year. After the song’s initial release, the so-called cult became a spearhead for new apparel and teasers as to when other songs were going to be dropped. Soon enough, the second song of the album, “Wonderful Life,” was released on October 21, 2018. This song features Dani Filth, leader of the band Cradle of Filth, and gives off the band’s signature metal vibe, although not as intense as their first few albums. However, fear not, old fans! Bring Me The Horizon delivers their most intense metal breakdown in “Heavy Metal,” the 12th song of the new album. Considering how long I have been dedicated to this band, I cannot help but give them some credit for venturing in a bold, new direction for the next batch of generational listeners. With old vibes and new experimental sounds, using combinations of pop, rock, and metal, I highly recommend giving "Amo" a listen. From all of the albums that they have released so far, this one...it’s a one-list-fits-all.
