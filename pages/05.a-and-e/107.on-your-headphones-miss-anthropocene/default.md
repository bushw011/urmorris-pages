“Cannot comprehend//Lost so many men//Lately, all their ghosts turn into reasons and excuses.” These lyrics, although hauntingly perfect for our current year of turmoil, are not from a news channel or an avid blogger. No, my friends, these are the odd utterings of one Claire Boucher, otherwise known as Grimes. Taken from her newest album, _Miss Anthropocene_, the world is set in a dystopian future where artificial intelligence (AI) has taken over, and our planet is practically laid to waste. The title alone suggests the state of our world today is leaning deeper into decay. _Miss Anthropocene_, a combination of “misanthrope” and “Anthropocene” is, 
as Grimes described on her Instagram last year, an “anthropomorphic Goddess of climate change.” 

The first track, “So Heavy I Fell Through The Earth,” starts off strong: Grimes’ chilling voice, like a fog coming over the listener’s ears, whispers the hopelessness of becoming pregnant, of surrendering your body to a lifelong commitment. For Grimes, this was an especially stressful situation, as her relationship with Elon Musk has created this alternative description of the nu-metal musician: The rich guy’s girlfriend, and now the bearer of his son, XÆA-12. While this album means to strike fear into the hearts of all who seek to rid our precious Earth of its native biodiversity, we are also introduced to a very personal side of Grimes: her journey to becoming yet another side dish in the media, as many women have been subjected to such treatment in the past. The second track, “Darkseid,” includes the lyrics used at the beginning of this review, lamenting over the Earth’s current state of being. Accompanied by Taiwanese rapper 潘PAN, also known as Aristophanes, the track feels more like a threat to the rest of humanity, to anyone who dares meddle with the divine order. The third track, “Delete Forever,” was actually written on the night that Lil Peep died, as an homage to dying artists who succumbed to the opioid crisis. Although this song is not of the typical Grimes aesthetic, I can seriously appreciate the lyrics for what she is trying to convey. In the description of her “Delete Forever” music video, the melancholy musician said it best: “It’s about losing friends to the opioid crisis and the self-hatred that arises when the grieving process mimics the behaviors that cost your friends their lives.” The rest of the album follows a similar theme to the first two tracks, with icy vocals muddled over a robotic instrumental, crying out over life, love, and/or our dying planet. There are also tracks that were simply made for the hell of it, like “Violence.”

An album that is not afraid to delve deep into the inevitable destruction of humanity, released mere months before the COVID-19 crisis, shook the globe. Coincidence? I think not. Whether Elon Musk is an AI or not, one thing is for sure: if we want to be one with the universe (and appease the AI overlords), we should listen to _Miss Anthropocene_ and take better care of the Earth—before it is too late...

A+
