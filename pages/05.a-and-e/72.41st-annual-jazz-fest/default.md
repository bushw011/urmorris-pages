Friday, April 5, 2019 was a special day for those in the Morris jazz community, as UMM hosted their 41st Annual Jazz Fest in Edson Auditorium at 7 p.m. This year, the theme was the most important precursor to jazz—and one of America’s first musical art forms—the blues. Tickets were $10 for adults and seniors and $5 for UMM students.

There were multiple evening performances by the UMM Jazz Ensemble 1, the guest artist quintet, West Central All-Stars Big Band, and the UMM Alumni Jazzers Big Band.
This year’s guest artist quintet was made up of Matt Leder on trumpet, Scott Agster on trombone, Ryan Frane on piano, Joey Petit on bass, and Pete James Johnson on drums.

Every spring, students have the opportunity to work alongside internationally recognized jazz artists and showcase their talent in the annual Jazz Fest. The festival was founded by UMM jazz-legend Jim “Doc” Carlson in 1978. Previous guest artists include Ellis Marsalis, Clark Terry, John Patitucci, Robin Eubanks, Ingrid Jensen, and Gary Smulyan.
