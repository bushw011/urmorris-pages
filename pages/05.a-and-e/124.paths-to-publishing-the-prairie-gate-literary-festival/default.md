On Thursday, Feb. 11, UMM hosted the Prairie Gate Literary Festival, a biennial celebration of writing, from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. There was a panel of writers available for a live Q&A via Zoom, including Peter Bremer, UMM librarian and self-published fantasy author, as well as the Prairie Gate Literary Festival Coordinator. Bremer gave me the run-down of the event. 

“The mission of the Prairie Gate Literary Festival  is to provide the University of Minnesota, Morris and Lake Region of Minnesota unique opportunities to learn from and interact with published writers and other professionals in the field of literary arts through such activities as readings, workshops, and panel discussions. Invited authors are chosen partly for the diversity of their backgrounds and styles, and are meant to appeal to a wide variety of audience members.”

Accompanying Peter on the group of panelists were UMN Morris English professor and poet, Angela Hume, children's book author Deb Mercier, UMN Morris alum  and self-published fiction author, Andrea Glynn, and UMN Morris alum and self-published Native American cookbook author, Derek Nicholas. Joining the panel was Rachael Knafla, President and Poetry Co-Chair of Floating World, who presented information about the writers group, Floating World, and explained the process of how the student-run group publishes their annual book of submissions. 

The panelists shared their personal experiences with publishing works and gave plenty of advice to the eager audience members. Roughly 40 people were in attendance. Panelists were asked about agents, to which they all answered that they find work on their own, and when asked about commissions, that they handle it through personal connections. A proper tightly knit group of creators!

The panelists also did not have any major concerns about piracy, saying that while there were some mentions of their work being used as click bait, no theft has been reported. Panelist Derek Nicholas shared that his method of alleviating piracy concerns is by simply making his book free to read.

I asked Bremer what the most notable pieces of advice for aspiring writers were on publishing their works.

“Have persistence and try to develop a thick skin. Build relationships. An MFA in creative writing isn't necessary to write fiction, but it can be helpful. Look within yourself and identify your passions. Learn about grant opportunities to help with publishing costs. There are many ways to get your work of fiction out into the world. There are traditional publishers, which usually require having an agent. There are small presses and vanity presses. And then there are lots and lots of self-publishing avenues such as Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Blurb, to name just a few. One advantage of self-publishing is that you get to be part of the whole process and have more control. You also have to do more work. If you do self-publish, you can use services like Upwork to hire freelance professionals.”

The Prairie Gate Literary Festival will continue with events on March 11 and April 9. The March event, “A Conversation Among Three Fantasy/Sci-Fi Writers,” will be held from 7-8 p.m. and will feature Joshua Phillip Johnson, Rebecca Kuang, and Farah Naz Rishi.

The Prairie Gate Literary Festival is made possible by the voters of Minnesota through grants from the Lake Region Arts Council, thanks to a legislative appropriation from the Arts and Cultural Heritage fund. In addition, the Prairie Gate Literary Festival is sponsored by Briggs Library, Briggs Library Associates, the University of Minnesota, Morris Alumni Association, the Multi-Ethnic Resource Center, the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, the Division of Humanities, the English Discipline, the Commission on Women, and private donations.
