Siobhan Bremer would like to inform everyone that her Fundamentals of Directing class will be presenting 10-minute scenes from published contemporary plays for the public coming up soon. The event is called A Morning of Theatre and will take place on December 5, 2017, from 10 to 11:40a.m. The plays will be in HFA Raymond J. Lammers Proscenium Theatre and they will be free of charge. Students will present their final directing project in this free, open-to-the-public event. The UR asked Bremer to give some follow up details about what they plays will be like and what putting them on means for her students.

> They will do a 10-minute scene from a play they selected. The assignment parameters were a full length contemporary published play that can be done with 2-5 actors on the proscenium stage. 

**How are the plays selected? **

> The students are given the parameters above and then I open my library of plays to them.  They read scripts and select one with an appropriate scene for the assignment. 

**Is there a designated theme to the play selection or how they are produced by students?**

> We do not have a theme although as part of the assignment they must do a production pitch. I set it up as if they were being interviewed for a directing job. They do a presentation sharing the merits of the play and why company X should select that show and them as a director. They talk about the author's intent, the themes of the play, possible meanings of the title, share a design concept, explain why this play is important to present today, and what they can bring to the play with directorial choices. 

**What type of work do students put into putting on these 10 minute scenes?**

> Big question. In addition to the presentation above they direct it. What does that involve? They research the play itself as well as material on and about the playwright, they do script analysis which informs them about the intricacies of each character, the technical needs and it helps them create blocking (movement for the characters from point A to point B) and business (the movement within the blocking), they decide how the space should be set up to best tell the story, they do what we call table talk (talking with the actors about their character and how that character fits within the play as a whole, they test out the blocking (or movement) with actors and adjust when needed to tell the story visually, they create stage pictures (stop action moments) to support the story at any given moment, they figure out and talk with the actors about the character they are playing  which includes what the characters is really saying underneath the lines, the conflict or inciting incident that got the play rolling along, the structure of the play including rising action, build to climax, and resolution or denouement. They work with actors to get the action to appear realistic. They organize a schedule so they are ready by presentation day and they journal what they did in each rehearsal so they can plan what to work on in the next rehearsal. They figure out pacing, help actors find the balance between emotional expression and control as an actor, projecting emotions out to an audience without overdoing it, and so much more. They learn to be flexible, collaborate, organized, creative, verbalize what they want to see visually, detailed, perceptive.

**What are some memorable scenes from previous years?**

> I can't recall specifics but generally the ones students really enjoy address social issues or are REALLY funny.  

**Can students not taking the course now or next offering of the course help beyond just attending the scenes?**

> Yes anyone can take part in the scenes as an actor as long as they are free during our class period. We are always looking for actors and this year our class is larger so finding enough actors has been tough. We announce in Intro to Theatre and send an email out to students (or we did in the past).

**So the prereq order is 1101 --> 1111 --> 2101. What other experiences or classes prepare students for this 2101?**

> Any involvement in productions including attending them preps people for this class. Watching and taking note how other directors work gives much insight for future directors. We also have a student run theatre club and students involved can submit to direct for that group as well.  

**How does 2101 fit into the grand scheme of a theatre major/minor?**

> It is a class generally taken in the first year after the Intro and acting class and sets the student up to take Advanced Directing. It is vital for anyone going out into the theatre world to understand the role of a director. In the Western World of theatre the director is the overseer of the entire production. On Broadway there are directors at many levels including Associate Director/Resident Director and Assistant Director. Directors have a LOT of responsibility and must learn to be both organized and creative (left and right brain) and it can be a challenge for many. It is a great deal of work but as I see it as FUN work.
