Fu Manchu has returned from cryogenic stasis once again to unleash upon us puny Earthlings their brand of fuzzed-out skate metal featuring gigantic riffs and crushing drums—they almost succeed. Reminiscent of their fourth album, _The Action is Go_, _Clone of the Universe_ spends much of its time jazzed up with adrenaline while also giving the listener time to head bang after shredding the halfpipe in Zorg’s _Great Expanse_.

The album opens strongly with “Intelligent Worship”, showcasing Fu Manchu’s laidback funk in the verses, their thrash-ability in the choruses, and concluding with a hint of doom influence and angsty solos. This is basically the thesis of the album: the first four songs are laidback and thrashy, the next two are down-tempo, though still within the bounds of adrenaline-inducing, and its concluding track harkens back to the 1990s with a mic of doom and the avant-garde. 

The weakest point in the album, in my opinion, is “Il Mostro Atomico.” It just goes on for too long (20 minutes), focuses on a slow developing instrumental center, and doesn’t keep my attention (then again, I have ADHD, so don’t listen to my opinion).

The strongest points in the album are both of its slower tracks: “Nowhere Left to Hide” and the title track “Clone of the Universe.” Fu Manchu does an excellent job with its down-tempo tracks and it disappoints me that they don’t write more of them (“Saturn III,” “Laserbl’ast,” [sic] and “Grendel Snowman” are some of my favorite Fu tracks).

Overall, their general ideas are cool, however some of their riffs aren’t as big as they should be, and they should have included more tracks on the record.
