MISSIO released their third album, “Can You Feel The Sun”, on Oct. 23 of last year. To be frank, I had planned on writing about this when it came out but I simply did not enjoy it. At first glance, I assumed that the synth-pop duo had concocted yet another album for the misunderstood, for those who feel they need a voice. At the time, this is not what I sought out. We were on the horizon of a new year, and I did not wish to be dragged back into the same rhythms and feelings as their 2017 album, “Loner.” However, I was sorely mistaken, and once I had finally plucked up the courage to give it a listen, I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, there was the quintessential MISSIO track about the freeing powers of marijuana, as well as the typical usage of the album’s best instrumental for the majority of their “filler,” less interesting songs. But overall, I enjoyed the laidback evolution of their past works. “Can You Feel The Sun” starts off with the title track, which hits heavy on both lyrics and cozy vibe. Continuing the MISSIO mantra of addressing mental health, the duo sings about how it feels when you just try to live your life while being wary of how others may view you and your way of living. Similarly, the music video is filled with an eruption of cascading colors during the chorus, as verse after verse, you are reminded that no one is an outcast, but rather, a fearful individual who is simply seeking love and support from the people around us, from society as a whole. Unfortunately, this is the most that I can say on the album’s standalone points. The ambience of their tracklist has captivated me, and the mellow ballads - namely, “Don’t Forget To Open Your Eyes,” simply hugs the soul. But I feel like this release was rushed since the pandemic pushed back recording by several months for most bands. Would I recommend this album to anyone? Sure, but only as ambient music (maybe take out “Vagabond” and “Hoodie Up”). I was thrilled to hear about a new album, but hopefully MISSIO’s new album has more ingenuity and less recycled material.
