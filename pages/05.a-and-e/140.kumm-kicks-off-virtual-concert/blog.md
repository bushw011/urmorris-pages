On Friday, April 16, KUMM hosted a live virtual concert over Zoom with three local artists. The concert was free to attend with a link provided on the UMM Morris events calendar site. The live stream lasted from 7 p.m. to approximately 9 p.m. 

The first artist to perform was accordionist and songwriter Emily Kastrul, leader and one seventh of the chamber-pop group, Sister Species. Kastrul performed some of Sister Species’ 2020 release, “Light Exchanges”, which was full of different scenes in nature, as well as beautiful interpretations of movements in daily life. The audience was also delighted to hear some new, unreleased works that the accordionist was able to share with us. Kastrul’s writing is somber yet powerful, with a crowd favorite being a tune about the inevitable heat death of the universe.

Although the songs performed were stripped down and six members last, I could feel the warmth of the music and the dedication in her words as Kastrul performed for us. I highly recommend listening to “Light Exchanges,” and giving Sister Species a listen.

The second artist to perform for the night was Cory Coffman. Coffman is a Duluth songwriter, arranger, and multi-instrumentalist who uses bohemian-punk ethos with indie pop sound to create poetic music with a deeper meaning.

From freelance drumming and percussion work to trying out whatever he felt would be most exciting, Coffman is an optimist who will warm your heart the moment you listen to his music. He performed his debut album, “Canvas and Color,” and the audience was very enthusiastic.

The third and final artist of the night was a band called Coyote Kid. Previously known as Marah in the Mainsail, Coyote Kid is a Minneapolis-based band with very powerful storytelling elements captured in their music. They performed their album, “Prowler,” and with each band member’s powerful style colliding into one another - Durry’s gruff vocals and Cassandra’s tender cadence being the most noticeable dichotomy - the imagery manifested was too powerful for words to fully express. I highly recommend “Prowler” to anyone who is new to narrative music, as the second you find it, you will become addicted to its power.

All three artists had a powerful story to tell, and KUMM was more than happy to provide a platform for them to get together and perform for us in a safe manner. Although the academic year has come to a close, our journey through the cosmos is only just beginning. Stay safe, and stay strong, dear readers.
