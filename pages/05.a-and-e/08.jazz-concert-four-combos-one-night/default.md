The UMM Jazz Ensemble performance took place at 7:30p.m. on Monday, November 7 in the HFA Recital Hall. There were over sixty attendees. This concert featured the four Jazz Combos-- smaller bands that usually feature a rhythm section (drums, bass, and piano) along with trumpets, saxophones, and guitars.

The first Combo to take the stage was the Blue Note Combo, featuring Roen Aronson (on alto saxophone), Anthony Lovejoy (on trumpet), Jack Campbell (on piano), Annika Paulson (on upright bass), and Gary DeFrance (on drums). Their first piece was a jazz arrangement of the _Game of Thrones_ theme, transcribed by Aronson. Spencer Walton, a freelance musician and Morris alumnus said that the piece had a nice build up from the trumpet and saxophone players, and that “[It was] cool that [the] concert had students’ original works… [They looked] like they [had] a lot of fun playing together. [They’re] comfortable taking chances.” The second piece was “Redbone”, a Childish Gambino piece arranged by Jack Campbell. During Campbell’s solo, he plucked strings from inside the piano, which gave it a unique sound. Aronson also sampled Smash Mouth’s “All Star” during his solo, which was met with applause and laughter from the crowd.

In between bands, Jonathan Campbell, the organizer for the combos, gave some remarks. He advertised the upcoming concert featuring Tchaikovsky’s _Nutcracker Suite_ in both its original form and the jazz adaption by Duke Ellington. The concert will take place on December 6 at 7:30p.m. and cost $1 for students. He then opened up the stage for the Impulse Combo.

The Impulse Combo featured Leah Raddohl on alto saxophone, Mikayla Bridgeman on tenor saxophone, Shane McKinley on piano, and Forrest Miller filling in on drums. Walton said that the strongest aspects to this group’s set was the comping , which gave the pieces a “secure foundation,” and their diverse selection of tunes. (For readers unfamiliar with the term “comping,” it essentially refers to the improvised chord playing that occurs in a jazz tune.) The Impulse Combo played “Back at the Chicken Shack” and “St. Thomas”, two slower pieces. “St. Thomas” had a calypso rhythm, which set it apart from the other pieces.

The Verve Combo featured Sterling Blonigen and Nathan Johnson on tenor saxophone, Thomas Pederson on bass, and Ben Lanning on drums. The combo also had assistance from Jonathan Campbell, who played electric bass. The Verve Combo played “You Don’t Know What Love Is” and “All Blues.” Walton particularly enjoyed the groove on “You Don’t Know What Love Is” and the improvisatory freedom of “All Blues.” This combo set the tone for what was a very musical and diverse program of small group instrumental jazz.

Jonathan Campbell then introduced the Prestige Combo, which featured Christian Pfeiffer on tenor saxophone, David Escudero on alto saxophone, Nate Polzin on electric guitar, Sampson Perrine on electric bass, and Forrest Miller on drums. They played “Speak No Evil” and “Gingerbread Boy.” “Speak No Evil” is a classic Wayne Shorter tune, which debuted on his 1964 album of the same name.  In his solo, Pfeiffer followed Aronson’s earlier example of including meme-based melodies in his solo by beginning it with a paraphrase of the intro to “We Are #1,” a song that first debuted in the Icelandic children’s show Lazy Town. Walton liked the swing in both pieces, and the “energy [the] performers brought to ‘Gingerbread Boy’.”

Musicians from these bands will also perform Tuesday, November 21 at 7:30p.m. at Old Number One for a jam session. Be sure to check it out!
