On Tuesday, March 2, the Morris Meninges Theater released a recording of their production of Iphigenia in Aulis, written by Euripides and translated by Robert Porter.

Iphigenia in Aulis is the last of the surviving works by the playwright Euripides. The play revolves around Agamemnon, the leader of the Greek coalition before and during the Trojan War, and his decision to sacrifice his daughter, Iphigenia, to appease the goddess Artemis and allow his troops to set sail to preserve their honor in battle against Troy.

The play began with an amusing narrator introducing the play as an animatic. They gave us the backstory and list of characters before opening the play with a beauteous chorus as the show began.

The director had a clever idea to represent each character by having the actors wear a mask with distinctive color markings around the eye holes, so as to make it easier for the small cast to switch characters easier. Subtitles were also provided, as the masks worn made it hard to hear some of the lines.

I will not spoil the tale: as I am writing this, the play is still available for viewing on the UMM Meiningens Student Theatre YouTube channel. 

What I will say is that the production did not lose any grandeur by being posted online versus performed to a live audience. The chorus carries a lot of weight throughout the story, with each line being read by the actors dripping with emotion. Iphigenia, a tragic tale, has so much depth that I found myself preferring the YouTube recording to the live version, for I could go back and rewatch earlier portions of the play in order to piece the story together. Euripides, while clever, did not write in simple sentences, and my heart goes out to the actors for learning such long, complicated lines of translated Ancient Greek.

The costumes, while simple, also did a great job of helping to distinguish characters from chorus.

I strongly recommend that you go online and watch the production of Iphigenia in Aulis, for while it is not the traditional theatre experience, it is truly unforgettable, and tears may flow from the woeful tale - particularly from Iphigeniaâ€™s lines. I typically try not to play favorites but Anika Dahl, you captured the sorrows of a doomed child in your voice most beautifully in your soliloquies.
