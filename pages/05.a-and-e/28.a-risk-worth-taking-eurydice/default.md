“Keep an open mind,” said Paige Quinlivan to a crowd of timid audience members. On February 1-3 in the Black Box Theater in HFA, Sarah Ruhl’s _Eurydice_ played its performances. The play revolves around the classic Greek myth of Orpheus, told from the perspective of Eurydice. During her pre-show announcement, Quinlivan encouraged audiences to take full advantage of a production like _Eurydice_. Why? Because the audience shared the stage with the actors.

The show was staged in promenade, a style of theater designed for an immersive and deeply intimate setting. The actors in promenade must navigate the space by walking in between crowds of audience members. With a minimalist set consisting of a few platforms, _Eurydice_ offered theater-goers a unique and immersive experience, nothing Morris theater has seen before. As an audience member, I was able to remain in close proximity with the actors at nearly all times. In one scene, I was only two steps from Eurydice.

Yet, a production with promenade possesses serious challenges that must be considered. Throughout the show several audience members were unable to see for periods of time because there was no elevated view of the stage that a traditional seating arrangement would offer. Some audience members needed to sit the entire show (on the select seats provided) and found it to be frustrating to only be able to hear the actors. Many people simply felt uncomfortable by the fact that they were in the scene with the actors; in promenade, no one can hide from the action. 

Why stage a production like this? Why take such a daring risk that would be so vulnerable to audience criticism? Quinlivan says that putting _Eurydice_ in promenade helps remove any disconnect audience members may initially have with show. She says _Eurydice_ is very much “otherworldly” and it often feels distant from our own lives. Putting the audience in the action helps make the storyline feel closer to our reality. Quinlivan is also a firm believer that audiences should not be seperate from the action of the play. “Modern audiences feel pressure to stifle their reactions or disengage from their emotions, particularly when it comes to theatre. People do not want to be disruptive, especially to an art form so commonly misconstrued as highbrow or pretentious.” Promenade may make audience uncomfortable, but it encourages them to engage, ultimately allowing them to enjoy the production more. 

With such an opportunity, an actor must approach the promenade style with an “all in” attitude. Heading the show as the title character, Bailey Soika delivered a smashing performance. She led the audience through Eurydice’s story of lost love and fatherhood. In the show’s final monologue, “To my husband’s future wife,” Soika wearily encaptured audiences with lines that brought steady tears to onlookers. 

The role of Orpheus was given depth and complexion by Caroline Vodacek. Vodacek brought an honesty and sincereness to the character; they needed to portray a large span of emotions. In the opening bits of the play, Orpheus and Eurydice marry; in these scenes, Vodacek gave Orpheus a confident and charismatic personality. As the show progressed with Orpheus searching for his lost wife, Vodacek seamlessly guided Orpheus’s personality to a broken and hopeless state. 

Mastering her performance, Katie Booth’s mannerisms as an elderly man stole moments of the show. Booth played Eurydice’s father who lives in the Underworld searching for his daughter. With rusty spectacles and a posture most definitely inflicted with osteoporosis, Booth nearly perfected the delicate art of acting like an elderly man. With her performance, the Father was sentimental and lovable: a true crowd pleaser. 


_Eurydice_ was not only daring for its staging style and intimate acting moments. A beautiful, originally composed score accompanied the show, adding to the Old Hollywood concept. Flirty jazz and beautifully haunting melodies were brought to life through composer and pianist Claire McManus, and a small band. 


Although there were many unique aspects of the actual show, much of the production’s charisma came from the director, Quinlivan. _Eurydice_ had been Quinlivan’s project for over a year and a half, and her directing style was one that we can all learn from. Quinlivan, when directing, creates a comfortable environment of inclusion, making all cast members feel safe and taken care of. After sitting in for a few rehearsals, I can truly attest to Quinlivan’s directing style; she radiates with positive vibes that establish a healthy learning environment that we can all learn from. 

For instance, at the beginning of every rehearsal, Quinlivan gathered all actors and production team members into a large circle facing one another. Each person “checked in,” essentially explaining how their day was and how their fellow cast and crew can help them achieve success in the rehearsal process. When I asked Quinlivan about this she said, “this sense of safety tends to enable people to go farther than they thought they could, or feel more comfortable taking risks.” The debriefing time before each rehearsal is a therapeutic process; Quinlivan thinks that “people perform better when they have someone who believes in them.” Quinlivan’s refreshing directing style marks her true passion for the theater and for helping others. 

I understand that I cannot give an unbiased view of _Eurydice_ because I was a part of the production team. Yet, there was so much that went into this show beyond the performances that is so rich and should be remembered. I will never forget the moment when I watched Quinlivan coach a nervous cast member through a difficult monologue. The ease with which she created supportive, yet challenging environment was inspiring. The unique ideas and individuals who brought _Eurydice_ to life model the satisfaction that risks can give us.
