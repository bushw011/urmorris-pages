With the _Kingsman_ having been released in 2014, expectations were set for another retro styled movie with all the fancy gadgets and effects of the 21st century. For those that do not know the synopsis of the movie (_The Golden Circle_), it is “when their headquarters are destroyed and the world is held hostage, the Kingsman's journey leads them to the discovery of an allied spy organization in the US. These two elite secret organizations must band together to defeat a common enemy.” (IMDb). 

Now some of the questions fans were asking: Are we going to get some more of that awesome spy fighting action? Will bringing back Harry Hart from the “dead” break or make this movie? Will they keep the cheesy supervillain/spy theme going like the first movie? Will the American spy organization be just as great as _Kingsman_?

I will let you know that the movie is still as classy as a _Kingsman_ martini and brings out some amazing fight scenes. While bringing back Harry Hart seemed odd after his “death” scene in _Kingsman_, he played up a great part in the storyline of spies vs. supervillain. As with their first villain, Valentine, the new and improved villain Poppy brought us back into the 1950’s while also bringing out a more ruthless touch. She kept up the “fulfill my demands or all die” in a very stylish way that made her a wonderful villain for our bespoke spies. 
Lastly, the American spy organization was a patriotic pride. The cowboy theme was awesome and their code names were all after different alcohols, giving them this cool western vibe.

I will also say that the movie was lacking in some regards to an attention getting storyline. There was too much cheesy comedy at times that took away from the movie. They played up actors in the movie that had very little screen time and ended up feeling more like a fishing line to get the movie more attention. Overall _The Golden Circle_ felt that it fell short to the first _Kingsman_.

The movie in whole had great actors that brought a very funny, action packed movie. If you enjoy action, cheesiness, and a bespoke suit this movie is for you. You will have a wonderful time watching a “bad but good” spy movie. Watch the movie and see for yourself how the story continues. Plus, Elton John is in it.
