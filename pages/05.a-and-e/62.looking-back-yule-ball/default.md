The campus hosted its annual Yule Ball on Saturday, December 8, 2018. From the New York City cityscapes outlining the walls of the student center to the residence hall banners from years past and constant references to the Fantastic Beasts series, it truly was “a ball.” With the student center as New York City in the 1920s and Louie’s Lower Level decorated as Central Park Zoo, music was a-blaring and heels were a-clicking to the biggest event of 2018. 

Admission cost $3 for one person, or $5 for two, complete with food and drink tickets. The food was catered and decoratively served in Hogwarts-style decor, including “floating candles” and Gryffindor-themed red and golden tables in the Turtle Mountain Cafe. Some of the snacks included “wizard wands,” which were chocolate-dipped pretzels, and the Wizarding World’s most iconic drink, “butterbeer,” which was a sickly-sweet, alcohol-free, carbonated beverage. Also being served were a variety of cupcakes with edible prints of Fantastic Beasts characters, as well as a large cake with similar prints. 

Freshman and Ravenclaw Jordyn Meyer shared her thoughts on the event, as well as the preparation that the Yule Ball Committee went through to make sure that everyone on campus was hyped for the event. 

“Preparations began early on because the decorations and pretty much everything else went along with the theme," she said. "We promoted the event through post[ing] a lot on the forum, we sold chocolate frogs, we made a hype video, and we had a Quidditch hype event. We also started decorations really early in the semester, so we weren’t so busy and stressed out before the actual dance. This made things run pretty smoothly.”

As far as the inspiration for the dance, the committee turned to the books and movies for help with the details of the decorations.

“We tried to draw as much inspiration from the books and movies as possible for the dance — we were those ‘extra’ fans,” Meyer said. “We pulled quite a bit from the movies, especially for decorations. We had a ‘museum’ of animals from the movies in Louie’s Lower Level, a few skylines of New York, wanted posters of characters from the movies, and colors inspired from the 1920s.”

The Yule Ball was a popular event on campus, not only because of its allure to the students who attended, but because it involved multiple clubs on campus as well.

“Many other clubs also tabled and did many activities inspired from the movies, like wand making, trivia, and finding out your Hogwarts House. I thoroughly enjoyed being a club member,” Meyer said. “I love helping put on large events like dances, and it was even more enjoyable that it was Harry Potter themed as I am a huge fan of the books and the movies. It was nice to find friends who liked the Wizarding World as much I do, and I have made some close friends because of the club. Seeing all the decorations and a lot of people having a good time made the entire night one of the most memorable ones thus far in college.” 

Nicole Abraham, another Yule Ball Committee Co-chair, commented on how this year’s theme stood out from previous years. 

“We’re not actually completely certain about how many attendees we have, as that’s not something we’ve been able to keep track of,” she said. “I’d estimate we had somewhere between 200 and 300 this year. This was the ninth dance we’ve hosted. A big difference is that each year, we have a different dance theme. For the first seven years, each dance followed one of the books. Last year we did a “best of” event, picking our favorite ideas from over the years. One change we made this year is that we chose to have a costume contest style event, instead of the sorting ceremony of the past two years. People seemed to enjoy it, and it was a lot of fun for us!”
