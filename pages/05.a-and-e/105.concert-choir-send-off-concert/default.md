On Saturday, March 7, the Concert Choir performed their send-off concert in the HFA Recital Hall before their scheduled trip to Peru, which was unfortunately cancelled due to the virus outbreak. The repertoire consisted of traditional Peruvian choral works, as well as pieces by Michael McGlynn, Hans Leo Hassler, Sydney Guillaume, René Clausen, and Stephen Paulus. The choir also premiered a new piece, “Primavera in Silencio,” by Joshua Shank. There was a pre-concert talk at 6:45 p.m. with composer Joshua Shank and poet Dr. Robert W. Ressler. The concert was from 7:30 to 9 p.m. The event was $5 for Adults, $3 for seniors, and $1 for students and children.

The first selection of pieces was titled, “Spiritual Expressions,” and consisted of McGlynn’s “Media Vita,” Hassler’s “Dixit Maria,” and 17th century piece, “Hannacpachap Cussicuinin.” While the first two of the three pieces are sung in Latin, “Hannacpachap Cussicuinin” is sung in Quechua, an indigenous language primarily recognized in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. “Media Vita” carries strong, rhythmic chants with dark undertones, while “Dixit Maria” brings a bright burst of energy, akin to the songbirds of spring. Closing the first selection, “Hannacpachap Cussicuinin” is an ode to the Virgin Mary, with the starting lyrics “Heaven's joy! A thousand times shall we praise you.” The recital hall was filled with vibrance, and after a brief pause for applause, the second selection began.

The second selection of pieces was titled, “ Silent Spring,” and consisted entirely of Joshua Shank’s “Primavera in Silencio.” Personally commissioned by Brad Miller, “Primavera in Silencio” is a seven-movement piece composed by Joshua Shank, created with the help of Dr. Robert W. Ressler, a passionate poet and scientist who has worked with Shank on multiple occasions. The piece is focused on the theme of environmental awareness, with each movement featuring an animal (with the exception of the last movement, which is titled “Human”). The sounds of the animal are beautifully captured in each movement, with “Human” concluding the piece on a triumphant note.

The third selection of pieces was titled “Such is Time,” and consisted of Felipe Coronel Rueda’s “Estrellita del sur” (which was previously performed at the Valentine’s Day fundraiser banquet) and Clausen’s “Quicksand Years,” which is the second movement in Clausen’s “Three Whitman Settings.” 
Sung in Spanish, “Estrellita del sur” is a Peruvian waltz, known for its warm rhythms that originated in the 1800s. The piece is a ballad, entailing the sorrows that one feels for their beloved, who has passed. They refer to their beloved as “estrellita del sur,” which can be translated into English as “little star from the south.” Although the ballad is about a widow’s loss, the choral arrangement gives an uplifting tone to the bittersweet piece, ending each verse with the message that, in time, the widow will join her deceased lover and embrace him once again.

The fourth selection of pieces was titled, “Longing for Home,” and consisted of Alcides Carreño’s “Todos vuelven” and Stephen Paulus’ “The Road Home.” “Todos vuelven,” which is Spanish for “Everybody returns,” has a powerful sense of community instilled in the piece. Similarly, “The Road Home” is about returning or coming home after being lost in the world, searching for peace.

Last, but certainly not least, is the fifth selection.

The fifth selection of pieces was titled, “Together is Better,” and consisted of Guillaume’s “Twa Tanbou.” “Twa Wanbou,” is written in Haitian Creole. The song is playful in nature and tells the story of three drums learning to work together. Finishing this concert with strong messages of community was a wonderful decision, and even as we are staying home, I implore readers to listen to these pieces. What the world needs is a strong sense of community, and this repertoire captures it with utmost ease.
