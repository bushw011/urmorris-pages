On Thursday, Oct. 1, the Master Gardeners gathered at the Student Center and brought their beautiful budding plants for the annual plant adoption event. The plant adoption is usually conjoined with the farmer’s market on campus, but we were not able to host the farmer’s market this year. To me, potted plants seem like a fruitless effort, especially since the plant adoption featured purely decoration plants, such as cacti and succulents. Curious, I asked David Israels-Swenson, senior director of Student Activities, about the purpose of the plant adoption event. 

“House plants are a great way to warm up any interior space, bringing a bit of the outdoors in.  They help make a space feel like home and I believe that for the master gardeners it can be both an outreach program and perhaps a tool to educate students about botany and gardening.” 

The event began at 11 a.m. Because of the chilly weather, the sale moved from the Mall to the Student Center. I approached the Student Center a few minutes after 11:00, expecting a small group of excited students huddled around a table. 

I seriously underestimated the number of anthophiles on campus. 

Upon approaching, I saw a herd of people crowding around Higbies, with a thick line of semi-socially distanced students trailing down the stairs leading down to Louie’s Lower Level. As I stood in the increasingly growing line, I contemplated leaving for a bit. After all, the line could not get any worse than 50, right?

Once again, I was rendered speechless. The sheer numbers kept rising, and soon the line curled around Louie’s Lower Level...twice. This turnout was mind blowing, even for Israels-Swenson.

“We knew there would be about 100 plants to give away (final number was actually 140).  We were not sure what to expect in terms of how much excitement this would elicit from students.  We had not heard much buz in response the posting on the facebook forum or posters that had gone out the week prior, so our hope was that we would at least be able to give away all of the plants and expected that it would take all day and perhaps some additional communication through social media later in the day to remind people that there were still plants available,” Israels-Swenson said. “We did not expect a line of over 40 students to form before the event even started.  In the end we gave away all 140 plants, so it is clear that at least 140 students participated.”

As time kept ticking away, group after group of students marched down the flooded staircase, hugging their little green friends. Although many left with smiles adorned on their faces, others were unable to keep their patience. Some left the line, while others were discouraged as they opened the doors of the Center. One student told me that while they enjoyed the event, they also recognized that this was a new problem that would need to be addressed for future events.

“People initially were not social distancing at all, but it improved a lot once Dave Israels-Swenson started actively reminding people. With as much traffic as there is in the Student Center, I think most people were concerned that if they didn't look like they were in line, they would lose their place in the long line. We just aren't used to how distanced lines look and feel! Perhaps having a space for the line (like within a rope or inside Edson), would make people reassured they wouldn't lose their spot and be more willing to distance.” -Student

Israels-Swenson had the same idea, originally planning to have the event outside. Now, however, he has contemplated setting up belts for crowd control.

“Had we known that that many people would show up in advance we would have used stanchions to better organize the direction and flow of the line. Our original plan had been to hold the event outside on the mall, but the cold temperatures on Oct. 1 prevented us from doing so.”

After 45 minutes of waiting around (and worrying that all of the plants were going to be gone), I was able to get to the front of the line. All of the anxiety was gone, there was no room for complaints. The Master Gardener was patient with me as I, just as all of the students before me had, took my time with selecting a lovely new addition to my dorm room. For those who are curious, I settled on a German Wax Ivy, who has yet to receive a name worthy of her stature. 

Although this event had some unexpected problems, I still encourage all students to attend any events that they can, whether it be on campus or via Zoom. These efforts are being put forth by the faculty who want to see us succeed, and we should do our best to show our love and support as well!  Image courtesy of UMM Student Activities.
