UMM Dance Ensemble hosted their end-of-semester performances last weekend. They performed on Friday, April 26 at 7 p.m. and twice on Saturday, at 1 and at 7 p.m. Tickets were $6. The event took place in Edson auditorium, and had an impressive turnout. This year’s choreographers blew the audience away with 24 performances, ten of which were Senior Pieces. The show opened with a group performance of “The Greatest Show” from the all-too familiar film, “The Greatest Showman”. From there, various genres and styles were flaunted on the stage. 

From “Stand in The Rain” by Superchick, to Ozzy Ozbourne’s “Crazy Train,” every performance held a story and captured the passion of the music with equally passionate dancers. Some pieces were simply there for the humor, such as Broz Aerobics, which featured six male dancers partaking in workout routines set to Pat Benatar’s “Hit Me With Your Best Shot,” Olivia Newton-John’s “Physical,” and Michael Sembello’s “Maniac.”

This year had a considerable number of dancers transferring or graduating after this semester, and I only felt it appropriate to include their names here (signified by an asterisk), as well as the rest of the incredible dancers who were in the show.

Without further ado, here is the program:
