As February rolls in, I feel a wave of emotions. Exams are pounding at the door but I have no way to mitigate my ever rising stress. From December to now, I have sat in my chair, hoping to stumble across the quintessential “feel good” album: a soft melody that doesn’t require an acoustic guitar, the type of positive energy that makes you smile amidst the late night struggles.

Although I cannot cater to every person’s taste, I think it’s safe to say that The Midnight’s 2014 EP, “Days of Thunder”, is a fairly good candidate. In case you aren’t familiar, The Midnight consists of singer/songwriters Jamison Tyler Lyle and Tim Daniel McEwan. The duo creates synthwave, with their famous mantra being: “There is a Japanese term: Mono no aware. It means basically, the sad beauty of seeing time pass — the aching awareness of impermanence. These are the days that we will return to one day in the future, only in memories.” Their discography radiates retro 80s, bringing feelings of nostalgia, of wearing a cozy flannel while holding a cup of tea on a rainy day. “Days of Thunder” is slow and soothing, with memorable lines from each song, catering to those who just need a good pick-me-up.

An example of this would be the chorus to Gloria. “Oh, Gloria/I feel so much better/I feel so much better today/And it’s not the drugs/And it’s not the weather/I just feel so much better today”. Other songs, like Days of Thunder, are filled with somber lyrics, which become lost in a sea of warm electronic melodies. For that 2:00 drive, for that paper due at 11:59, here it is: the album of all “feel good” albums.
