On Friday, February 2, Ana Miller, accompanied by Stephen Swanson on piano and Simon Tillier on clarinet, performed “American Beauty: Vocal Music by Living American Women Composers.” There were three pieces performed in total, each with several different movements. The pieces were composed from poems from Rolf Jacobsen, E.E. Cummings, and Emily Dickinson. Ana Miller, the coordinator of Morris’ voice department, is an active vocalist who has performed as a soloist and with many different choirs throughout the country.

The evening started with an entrancing performance of a piece called “Nattsanger,” which translates from Norwegian to “Night Songs.” Dr. Henrik Wilberg, an assistant German professor at University of Minnesota, Morris, assisted in translating and coaching the pronunciation of these Norwegian poems. “Nattsanger”’s seven unique songs each depict a separate, specific portion of time between sunset and sunrise. One highlight of this piece was in the seventh movement, titled “Sjofugl” or “Seagulls”, which featured an interesting clarinet accompaniment by Simon Tillier that brought to mind seagull calls. 

The second composition, “though love be a day” was made up of four dramatic poems by E.E. Cummings, and approach the topic of love, whether it be deep romantic love or light infatuation. Dr. Gwyneth Walker, the composer, received awards and high praise for this assembly of unique and descriptive works.

Wrapping up the evening beautifully was a performance of Jocelyn Hagen’s composition, “Hope”, which features four poems by Emily Dickinson. These songs express the idea of hope in many different forms. Ana Miller brought emotion and depth to this conclusion, as well as the rest of her performance.
