The Morris International Student Association (ISA) put on the Spring Festival on Friday, February 16, to celebrate a new zodiac year. Many Asian countries celebrate the holiday, including China, Singapore, Thailand, Korea, and Indonesia among other countries. The UMM festival brings this tradition to the USA by commemorating this new Year of the Dog with food and entertainment held in Oyate Hall. Those in attendance were given a raffle ticket at the door for drawings that would be interspersed in between performances given throughout the later portion of the festival. Once everyone was settled in at a table, ISP members greeted the audience and bowed. A video of the previous Spring Festival (Year of the Rooster), shot and edited by Samuel Yuan, set the mood of the festival and gave those in attendance a feeling of what was to come. 

If one was born in 1934, 1946, 1958, 1970, 1982, 1994, 2006, or the current year 2018, they would be born in a zodiac dog year. ISA gave people born in those years the first opportunity to try the food offered. The meal included: shrimp tempura, korean fried chicken thighs, garlic savoy cabbage, vegetarian chow mein, white rice, and mango coconut tapioca. The next few opportunities to get food before other tables of people came with answering trivia about those born in the Year of the Dog. Tables that answered how those born on Dog years are characterized as honest or loyal got to go next. 

Once every table had their chance to get their food, eat, and mingle with each other, performances with raffle drawings in between commenced. The first was Gavin Cao performing “Music at Sunset” on the piano. The song started slow with fluttering parts but gave way to a higher tempo. Afterwards, the first raffle had two rounds because the first number was not claimed. Then Vanessa Wan sang “Boy.” The performance had to end a bit early due to some technical problems with the speakers. The second raffle winner won an electric kettle. 

The next performers were Ruby DeBellis and Ahnaf Prio performing Corinne Bailey Rae’s 2006 song “Put Your Records On.” DeBellis specified that the song was chosen in part due to it being released during the previous Year of the Dog. DeBellis had the audience clapping along to the beat by the end of the song. This performance was followed by another drawing for a kettle and then a lovely performance by Evey Wu singing “City of Stars,” which they accompanied with piano. Following another drawing, Wan again took the stage with Danni Lao for another song. Wan began with a piano piece which was followed by a song played on the speakers to accompany Lao’s singing. People clapped as Lao came on stage to sing a song about lovers. Partway through the music cut out but Lao kept going strong and everyone cheered and clapped along. Lao took the twist very well and ended their performance by wishing the audience a happy Valentine’s Day and new year. Following the song and another raffle was the last series of performances which were presented by the Asian/Pacific American Coalition. Kriss Baye and Andrea Wathanaphone recited original poems and Janie Dam recited the lyrics of a popular Vietnamese song. Transcripts of the poems and lyrics are below the end of the article.

All that was left, apart from closing remarks after the performances, was raffling off the last few items. ISA managed to make the series of raffles interesting by pumping up the audience in anticipation. The audience was encouraged to “drum roll” along as the winner of bluetooth speakers and an electric toothbrush were chosen. After all prizes were given away there were still some left over peanut butter M&M’s left which were meant to be given out for answering trivia questions. The audience in a drum roll and raffle fervor opted out of trivia to raffle off the last few boxes. The first winner’s love for peanut butter was apparent as they cheered and ISA encouraged the last winner to be even more enthusiastic when they won. The last box was given away with a cheer from the audience which ended the festival strong. The Year of the Dog started out strong in Morris thanks to the Spring Festival. Special thanks to ISP, Sodexo, the Student Activities Office, and all volunteers and performers.

My hair is black     
My cheek is purple    
My vein is blue    
Your clothes are green    
My skin is yellow     	    
The air is orange         	
Our blood is red          	

Pom coi see dum        
Gam coi see muang    
sane duart coi see fa            	
Kuang coi see keoh    
Piew coi see luang         	
r gart see som     	    
duart haow see dang       


**Kiếp Đỏ Đen By Duy Mạnh**		
_Spoken by Janie Dam_	
_(English and Vietnamese)_	

Now, I have nothing left    
My hands will always be empty    
A life of gambling is dishonest and ruthless    
I found money but like water, it will soon flow away    
The hands that are not empty, will they return?    

A wandering life like so    
Not knowing of tomorrow    
That's my reason of feeling bitter    
Sitting in front of a bright mirror, that’s when I see    
A devastated, withered corpse that I can’t recognize    

I carry so many guilt, that's why I'm like this    
A life without a home, without any close friends    
I carry so many guilt    
My beloved, I have nothing left    
Please stay away from the life of red and black    

Giờ ta chẳng còn chi 
Mãi trắng tay mà thôi  
Đời bạc gian lắm phủ phàng   
Tiền có kiếm như nước rồi cũng sẽ trôi hết   
Tay không trắng tay lại vẹn không   

Đời phiêu lưu là thế  
Không biết đến ngày mai   
Nên giờ đây mới đắng cay   
Ngồi trước tấm gương sáng rọi vào đó mới thấy   
Thân xác hoang tàn không nhận ra   

Ta mang bao tội lỗi nên thân ta giờ đây   
Kiếp sống không nhà không người thân  
Ta mang bao tội lỗi   
Người ơi ta đâu còn chi   
Xin hãy tránh xa kiếp đỏ đen    


**Friendship **		
_By Kriss Baye_

In grade school my best friends, they were Hmong 	
I didn't know much about them at the time, but we did get along.	

My closest friend? That kids name was Victor.	
He was quiet and stoic, but during dodgeball he'd be the victor. 	

When we played tag, he would sneak up on you and catch you	
After a couple games it became an issue.	

There was Mookda whose last name was Chanthavong	
Which I am proud to say I never once pronounced wrong.
	
She was smart, witty and always knew what to say	
When we went to the science museum she was blown away	
	
Then there was Nike! Who, when i think about it, acted alot like Bruce Lee	
He would talk like him, walk like him, even looked like him, you'd see!	

And like Nike said, “Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do”
