On Tuesday, March 2, approximately 180 folks stopped by the Turtle Mountain Cafe (TMC) and made their very own lucky bamboo, with materials also provided for making balloon stress balls filled with Orbeez. 

“The primary purpose of this event was to provide a friendly and covid-safe environment for students to come together and meet new people (and getting to take home a plant and/or stress ball is a bonus!). Most of the programs hosted by the Office of Residential Life so far this year have been virtual or asynchronous, so this event allowed us to host an in-person program for students.”
 
The idea of lucky bamboo was something lively to spruce up people’s rooms during the colder months, as well as something to relieve stress - thus, the stress balls. The lucky bamboo kit contained two bamboo shoots, a short glass, and some Orbeez to keep the verdant creature nourished.
 
“Due to the limited space in the TMC, we had to limit the number of participants at any given time, to ensure that we could maintain at least 6' distance between folks as they put together their bamboo kit and make stress balls. Instead of having one 60-90 minute long event, I broke it up into 10 different time slots, and advertised based on the area students live on campus. For example, 4-4:30 was reserved for mostly Indy AB Students. We also structured the layout of the event to only allow for four chairs/seats at each table, and made sure to set out supplies at each spot to minimize the number of hands touching the same objects.”
 
All in all, it was a successful event. Some may wonder why the TMC, why not have kits prepared for students to craft these in the comfort of their own home? Well, the idea was to create a tranquil space to interact with other students while still abiding by the CDC and MDH safety guidelines. 
 
“Putting together stress balls may seem obvious - students can squeeze them when they're stressed, but also it was mostly the idea of bringing students out of their halls and into another space together, to meet others and have small talk while they put the items together. Each table had small conversation starters at them, and during the event I overheard multiple examples of students introducing themselves to others and exchanging contact information. In a way, the program was able to initiate those random conversations that begin so many relationships on campus that students are missing right now, which decreases isolation and increases student support systems.”
 
Keep your eyes peeled for your calm and quiet events on campus and via Zoom!
