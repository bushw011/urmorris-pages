I have gravitated toward the like of Glass Animals’ “ZABA”, due to the way that the cover art accurately conveys the mood of the album.Before analyzing the album, let me introduce you to the British four-man band, known as Glass Animals. The four mates started out as childhood friends making music, debuting their album, “ZABA”, in 2014. Their style of music is psychedelic, and some may argue indie rock. “ZABA” is laid back in nature, with hidden wonders in every song, and these ideas can be tied to the color, line, and detailing of the cover art.

First, the color. With an array of soothing cool colors, ranging from faded plum purple to a quiet ocean green/blue, there is a relaxed mood already set.

Next, the lines. This album cover follows no laws of line, as squares, circles, and bodies of animals (with a man and woman included in the list) strewn across what appears to be a jungle background. Here, the so-called detail is in the haphazard inclusions of a plethora of animals, plants, and curious additions to this jungle hideaway. There is so much to see, so many simple characters hidden in the cover art, with some blending into the background quite cleverly.

Full of life, yet slowed down by the cool, faded colors, ZABA caught my eye as a psychedelic album before I had even read the artist’s name, which is written in orange gold print in the center, followed by the album name at bottom center.

With the album cover art in your mind, you’re probably imagining something loud and crowded, yet soft and soothing...well, you aren’t far off. Each song on the album has a similar structure, starting with the instrumental, slowly incorporating vocals, coming to a climax (sometimes multiple) about midway. The instruments used on this album are quite unique from traditional psychedelic music, incorporating wooden instruments into a guitar and synthesizer background, matched with soft, indie vocals that seek to lull you into a trance state. At times, the song can reach a bustling segment, full of energy and odd lyrics (as Glass Animals is well known for their hauntingly cryptic lyrics). This reminds me of the crowded images on their cover art: busy, yet calm.
