Editor's note:
I would like to sincerely apologize for an error made in our
last issue. I published an unfinished draft not including the
names of pieces played in Symphonic Winds' first performance.
Readers can check out the most recent performance on their
YouTube channel, which features Philip Sparke's Overture for

Woodwinds and a brass ensemble of George Frideric Handel's
Hallelujah Chorus.
Once again, my sincere apologies for any confusion that the
previous issue may have caused. Those responsible have been
sacked. Kidding.
