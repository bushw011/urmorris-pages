Recently, I had the opportunity to interview Elizabeth Ziman, lead singer of Elizabeth & the Catapult, about her quarantine-released album, “sincerely, e.” Ziman grew up in New York City where she had an early connection with music as a young, competitive classical pianist. Around 11 or 12, Ziman realized that her love for music drove in a different direction than that of the “professional classical child prodigy stage.” She took a short break from music, up until enrolling in Berkeley to study film scoring, and soon found herself landing once-in-lifetime opportunities, eventually creating what is now known as Elizabeth & The Catapult. 

Since then, Elizabeth & The Catapult has launched album after album, with “sincerely, e” being the fifth. Released on March 5, the album encapsulates the theme of loneliness through a myriad of lenses: from being isolated (much like many of us have had to endure for parts of this past year), to feeling utterly dependent on our phones and separated from reality, this masterpiece of tracks wormed its way into my heart from the first song, “birds and the bees.”

The album is piano heavy, something that I typically avoid as piano can become drab and monotonous, but not with this album. “sincerely, e” has distinct themes for each track that keep the instrumental interesting, with clever, carefully constructed lyrics to ponder over.

I do have to give one drawback to the album, and that is the pace. Personally, I like something lively that carries a unique tune, the only song that got my blood pumping was “thirsty.” Catchy tune but not my cup of tea. For the overall cozy vibe and well-written message, I rate this album a solid A-. If you need something to accompany you on those rainy days with a hot cup of tea, I highly suggest taking a peek at “sincerely, e,” as well as the music video of “together, alone” and the lyric video of “thirsty” on the Elizabeth & The Catapult YouTube channel, as well as on their website, elizabethandthecatapult.com.

I would also like to acknowledge that Ziman encourages people to stay passionate about what they love. Her hobby turning into a profession is something that many can only dream of, but what she says is anything can happen, as long as you keep working towards your goal. Here is a quote from when Ziman was talking about her brief hiatus after schooling, and the beauty of retaining what she had learned in her earlier years:

“When I stopped playing piano, I also stopped choir and I also stopped dance; I just had a complete break from music, until I decided to pick it up again in college. But even though I’m a songwriter now, there were about eight years after school where I didn’t compose anything for film and then I connected with documentary film scorer, Paul Brill. We have now scored about twenty-five films together. You never really know how these tools that you get earlier on are going to get used or when you’re going to use them, but if you keep making work for long enough, it always comes back around in a really interesting way.”
