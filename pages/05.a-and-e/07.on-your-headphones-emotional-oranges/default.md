You guys. I no longer lack vitamin C after coming across Emotional Oranges. It really does feel like summer in the winter despite the monstrous snowstorms that Minnesota just came out of. The Los Angeles-based R&B duo released their single, Personal, last July and I’ve had them on repeat for the past week. 

Though currently only having Motion and their latest release, Hold You Back, as two other singles in their discography, the incog artists are majorly serving sultry bedroom tunes in what is a future-forward alteration of R&B electronica. These tracks incorporate an intimate dialogue between the male and female singer that paints a picture of a push-and-pull relationship. Personal, in particular, let’s you hear a conversation about a partner’s frustration with constantly being provoked thus having to “take it personal.” The melodious chorus then goes into that partner’s tease with the lines “Better make it up tonight // You gotta do all the things I like // Wine and dine me right” and the other person later singing lines that implies they’re in agreement. This seems like a disastrous Taurus-Libra relationship if you had to ask but that’s beside the point. 

Emotional Oranges have been testing for trial and error in the recording studio for three years before establishing their own sound in 2018. With their singles slowly, but surely, gaining the recognition that they deserve, the duo will have their breakthrough in the industry soon enough as they currently have two projects in the works. Corner of my Mind is the title of what’s going to be their debut EP with the release date being kept a surprise. 

In the meantime, I would recommend giving Emotional Oranges a listen to hear their citrus-fused 80s aesthetic for yourself. Email me your opinions so that we can either hype it up or argue (I would like to clarify that I don’t condone violence--for the University’s sake).
