Morris may be a small town, but there’s no lack of things to do. Nowhere is this clearer than at Crystal Lanes, now featuring automated scoring! Make a visit to Morris’ very own bowling alley, open 3 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 3 p.m. to 12 a.m. Friday, 1 p.m. to 12 a.m. Saturday, and 1:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday.

On Sunday, Crystal Lanes has a special price: only $3 for a game and bowling shoes. If you’re looking for a bite to eat while you play, Crystal Lanes has pizza, snacks, and drinks of the non-alcoholic variety.
Pro tip: If you’re looking for cash, Casey’s is just a few
blocks down 5th Street–grab some cash at the ATM on
your way to the lanes!

Want to catch a movie? You don’t even have to leave town! Located on East 6th St, one block southeast of Willie’s Supervalu, the Morris Theatre is our very own two-screen cinema. The Morris Theatre Co-operative is supported by the community to bring first-run movies to the town of Morris every week. Tickets at the door are $6.50, but here’s a hot tip! If you go to the Information Desk in the Student Center, you can purchase tickets for just $5. Until September 20, the Morris Theatre is showing the films “The Meg” (PG-13) and “Alpha” (PG-13) on the main screen, and “Searching” (PG-13) on the micro screen. For specific showtimes, please visit their website at morristheatre.net for more details. 

If you’re looking for a place to pick up some inexpensive clothes or decorations for your brand-new living space, look no further than the Someplace Safe thrift store. Someplace Safe is a non-profit organization run mostly by volunteers. All of the wares sold at the Someplace Safe thrift store are donated by the community of Morris, and a portion of the proceeds are donated back to people in need. Someplace Safe is located on Atlantic Avenue, behind Willie’s Supervalu grocery store. The thrift store is open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday. 

Casey’s is the quintessential “I’m studying and need sustenance NOW” place. It is the only place in Morris that is open 24-hours. Please, if you need to take a walk, take a walk up 5th Street to Casey’s.
