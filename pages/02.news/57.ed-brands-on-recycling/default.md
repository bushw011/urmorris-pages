In order to learn more about recycling, one of the UR's News contributor asked social science professor Ed Brands to elaborate on the topic. To learn more about UMM's recycling division, read the UR's News article, "UMM Maintains Robust Recycling Despite Challenges." 

**What are the pros and cons of recycling in general?**

Pros: 

1) There is a chance that the material(s) will re-enter a production cycle and reduce the amount of energy, water, and raw materials needed to make a new product

2) Recycling does make us think at least a little bit about reducing our environmental impacts

3) The act of recycling may make us feel better (though this isn't necessarily always a 'pro')

4) Recycling does really work well in the context of some types of products--e.g. corrugated cardboard, aluminum, and ferrous metals (e.g. steel). It works best when done as part of an industrial cycle (i.e. within the factory); it is less effective at the household level.

Cons: 

1) A large proportion of materials that are sent to recycling bins or programs do not really end up re-entering production cycles and instead are sent to landfills or incinerators.  Taking this more circuitous route to landfills or incinerators may end up causing more emissions (i.e. from trucking) than if they were sent directly to these destinations in the first place.

2) Proponents of recycling have argued that recycling reduces the amount of 'virgin' material needed in society; recent research shows this is largely false, that whatever gains may be made by recycling have been absorbed by insatiable growth in consumption of (especially disposable) consumer goods.

3) Recycling as an approach to dealing with solid waste products is becoming much more difficult with the increasingly mixed nature of our waste. The use of "sandwich" packaging for products ranging from granola bars to tea and the perhaps more serious issues that include proliferation of nanotechnology and the integration of electrical circuitry and computer chips into more and more products suggests that our wastes will likely not be any simpler to recycle in the future.

4) In the case of plastic, recycling has for several decades been pushed by oil and petrochemical industries in order to confuse the public and pee on the campfires of communities organizing to ban plastic bags, single use plastic, and other products.  Recycling has never been intended to work as promised; no significant investments (compared to mining or petroleum exploration) have been made in recycling technologies, even though recycling could potentially offset lots of mined materials and the attendant pollution and other impacts.  The main purpose of recycling has been to alleviate pressure to reduce the production and consumption of single-use products, which we pay for when they are manufactured (if we live nearby and inhale the associated air pollution), when we buy plastic products, when we dispose of plastic products (solid waste disposal), when we breathe air pollution from garbage trucks or ships that transport plastic waste, when we ingest food that contains plastic (recent studies show that plastic microfibers can be found in beer, honey, shellfish, and other foods), and in many other ways (e.g. cleaning up beaches, oceans, etc.) which are not currently the responsibility of the producers and which especially in the case of oceans will have to be dealt with essentially forever.  90% or more of all plastic produced has not been recycled!

5) Recycling may make us feel better, but as currently practiced in the United States, it does very little to reduce environmental impacts.  It may give us a sense of it being ok to continue lots of single-use products or single use containers, most of which are unnecessary.  Who is to decide which single-use products are acceptable? That's an interesting question.  There is a whole continuum of acceptability ranging from probably absolutely necessary (e.g. medical supplies and personal protective equipment) to questionable at best (e.g. straws, disposable cutlery, bags).  The plastics industry will argue that plastic products are more flexible (it is tough to argue against that), that they are cheaper and that their environmental footprint is smaller. The last two points generally depend upon the alternative that plastic is compared to, and on what is considered (especially the time frame--paper bags do not last very long if they escape from a garbage truck-- and those pesky external costs like dead seabirds, or millions/billions of fish with reduced reproductive abilities) in the determination of cost and environmental footprint.

 6) There is a reason why recycle comes in third in the well-known jingle Reduce, Reuse, Recycle--it's by far the worst of those three strategies.  Unfortunately, many or most of us in the U.S. are unwilling to consider the first option (reduce) at all. Overall, we're not very interested in reuse either.  To my knowledge there have been more successful bids for political office associated with rehabilitating sewer systems (e.g. Shirley Franklin, who became Atlanta's "sewer mayor")  than with reduce or reuse as more effective ways of dealing with solid waste!

I should note that recycling does not make you or I a "bad person." I'm writing with the small hope that it will help us wake up to the reality that recycling is not a very good solution.  We may view it as the only alternative to placing something in the garbage can. But solving our solid waste problems has to come way before--as individuals when we purchase something (or not), or more importantly as a society when we encourage the oil and plastics industries with tax breaks, glorify conspicuous consumption (e.g. of electronics, clothes, automobiles), fail to encourage development of products and goods that are actually durable, or fail to implement rules about producer responsibility for products at the end of their lives (i.e. 'waste').

**What are some things most people don't know about recycling/have misconceptions about?**

See above-that recycling actually happens (it mostly doesn't, especially with regard to plastic), that it's something to feel good about (it shouldn't be, compared to reducing or reusing), or that it's even currently possible or economically feasible to recycle many of our recently developed products that mix lots of different materials together.

**Do you know of any recent global developments in recycling? **

There are three main recent developments that I'll mention (below). For anyone interested in keeping up with the latest developments related to solid waste (and recycling) on a daily or weekly basis, I would recommend subscribing to the Waste Management World e-newsletter that is published by the International Solid Waste Association (ISWA).

1) Other nations no longer want our garbage or recycling. China's recently implemented National Sword Policy (why can't we come up with good names like that here?!) has effectively cut off most shipments of recyclables from the U.S.  Other nations in Asia are following suit.

2) Related to #1, the price that can be obtained for recyclables has cratered.  In some communities, the cost of recycling programs is making it unaffordable to continue.

3) There are increasing signs that we might be close to admitting that relying on recycling as one of our main solid waste management strategies is a big mistake (or, more bluntly, a lie).  See any number of recent news articles (NPR, CBC, Vice) that showcase interviews with former oil company executives in which this is noted.
