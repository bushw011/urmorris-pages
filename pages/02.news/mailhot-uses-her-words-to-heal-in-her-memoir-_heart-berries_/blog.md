On Thursday September 6th at 7 p.m., Morris students, faculty and community members gathered in the Lammers Proscenium Theatre on the University of Minnesota Morris campus to listen to New York Times Bestselling author Terese Maire Mailhot read excerpts from her memoir Heart Berries, as well as take questions from the audience about her memoir and life as an up-and-coming author.  The event was presented by Native American Student Success (NASS) and followed a welcome dinner in Oyate Hall honoring Mailhot.
 
Mailhot is a Canadian native to the Seabird Island First Nation reservation in Seabird Island, British Columbia. She graduated from the Institute of American Indian Arts with Master of Fine Arts in fiction.  Before becoming an author, Mailhot worked as a columnist, editor, and teacher of English and Composition. She is also currently a creative writing professor at the Institute of American Indian Arts. Mailhot debuted as an author with her book, Heart Berries: A Memoir. Her memoir has received high praise as a New York Times Bestseller, New York Times Editor’s Choice, as well as several recognitions from major sources such as Entertainment Weekly and Huffington Post.  
 
From a synopsis from the online social book database “Goodreads,” Heart Berries follows the story of Mailhot through her younger years following events leading her to be hospitalized, facing the reality of being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar II disorder.  After being given a notebook to help her deal with her trauma, Mailhot birthed the creation that is Heart Berries, her memoir dedicated to her mother and a story of reconciliation with her father.
 
To begin the event, Mailhot read from two sections of her book: “The Leaving Deficit” and “Indian Condition.”  “Indian Condition,” as Mailhot explained, demonstrated how she wanted to be seen as in the world, rather than what she is seen in the meantime – a stereotype.  Throughout the question and answers session, students, faculty and members of the Morris community brought up a variety of questions; from Mailhot’s beginnings as a writer to how she found the voice to write about her dark past. Mailhot explained that Heart Berries was written originally as what she could remember from her life events, but then it was with the mixing of creativity and imagination that made her work unique.
 
To Mailhot, writing Heart Berries helped her heal.  She told the audience that with her words she took a lot of risk, both in the personal and public spheres. Writing and revision opened her up to create a stronger voice in the pages, to have authority over her own life again. She believes that one needs to be unafraid of risk and envision success; that the only risk in life is failure. When publishing and releasing her book to the public, Mailhot says that there is nothing that prepares you for that type of exposure.  But through that, she found that through all the success she has gained through her book, she still finds that all the fame has not changed her, “Still the same with all the fame. You can be better, but I think I am still the same Therese from when I was six years old.”
 
Mailhot spoke strongly against the social stigma of how victims of violence and sexual assault feel as if they are to blame.  Written on her Twitter account the same night as the event, Mailhot writes “I'm often asked how I can talk about trauma and abuse. I tell every reader, every bright student, that the shame doesn't belong to me. I'm not ashamed. The people who hurt me, that's their shame to carry, not mine. Abusers want us to carry shame and think it's our fault. No.”
 
University of Minnesota student, Becca Lund, spoke out on how Mailhot words connected to her own life and further motivated her to take pride of where she comes from; “To be honest, my jaw was on the floor by the time the author finished reading “The Leaving Deficit” to us. I grew up on a native reservation and I experienced a lot of poverty and alcoholism, so I felt like I could relate a lot to what she was saying. She also writes really gracefully and is really talented overall. I felt really empowered as a Native American after listening to her speak, and she made me feel like reaching the goals I have set for myself is much more attainable than I like to think.”
 
The event ended outside the Proscenium Theatre, where attendants were able to buy a signed copy of Heart Berries.
