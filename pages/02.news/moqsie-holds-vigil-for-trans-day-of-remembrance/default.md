On Monday, November 20, the Morris Queer Student Initiative for Equality (MoQSIE) held a vigil at 6:00 p.m. in Louie’s Lower Level for the Transgender Day of Remembrance. A memorial with brief biographies of transgender individuals who were killed in the year 2017 was constructed for the event. Kara Black, co-chair for MoQSIE and a trans woman herself, gave electric candles to those present. She proceeded to read the names, ages, and dates of death of those commemorated by the memorial. For each name spoken, an attendee was prompted to place their candle before the altar. “Remember them. Remember that no one is alone. Remember that anything that threatens one of us threatens all of us,” Black told the crowd once the last of the candles had been placed. “We will not forget our siblings who fought the hardest, who walked the most.” As the ceremony drew to a close, she informed those present that her decision to include the age of each victim was intentional, as “many of us are older now than many of them will ever have the chance to be.”

After the ceremony, many attendees stayed for an additional hour to share their support for the transgender community. When asked about the significance of the Transgender Day of Remembrance, Black told the University Register that it is “a day to remember those who died and to remember how much progress we have yet to make.” She believes that, through support from the community, there will be a day when vigils are no longer needed. 

The Transgender Day of Remembrance was started by a trans woman named Gwendolyn Ann Smith to remember those who had been killed as a result of anti-transgender prejudice. Her decision was spurred by the death of Rita Hester, a transgender woman who was murdered in 1998. Black informed those present at the event that the year 2017 holds the record for the highest number of deaths of transgender individuals since the day began. A total of 27 deaths were reported, though Black shared that two of those commemorated by the memorial were only reported through the Black and Pink LGBTQ Prisoner online pen pal program, a reminder that there were many more victims whose death went unreported. According to the biographies provided by MoQSIE, those commemorated were victims of crimes such as stabbings and arson, though the majority were victims of police shootings. They lived all across the nation, from Saint Louis, Missouri, to Corpus Christi, Texas, and even as close as Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
