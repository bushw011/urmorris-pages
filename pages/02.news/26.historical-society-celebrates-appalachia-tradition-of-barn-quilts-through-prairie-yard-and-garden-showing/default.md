On February 27, the Stevens County Historical Society hosted the premiere of an episode of _Prairie Yard and Garden_, a television show airing on Pioneer Public Television. The episode is about Barn Quilts, a tradition born in Appalachia that has found its way across the Midwest. The episode also contains links to the University of Minnesota Morris, one that many students may be unaware of.

Pioneer Public Television is an affiliate of the Public Broadcasting Service, otherwise known as PBS. Pioneer is based out of Granite Falls, Minnesota and has operated since 1966. Its founding was due in great part to the labor of women, who fundraised constantly to purchase the equipment and licenses to run a PBS affiliate. Pioneer to this day reflects the drive and character of West Central Minnesota, producing 7 shows with a staff of 26 and covering one of the largest geographic areas of any PBS station. From the Twin Cities to Central South Dakota, and from Duluth to Northwest Iowa, Pioneer broadcasts carry Rural Minnesota into many homes.

The University of Minnesota Morris has its own connections to Pioneer: the university produces _Prairie Yard and Garden_, faculty and relevant university programs and research have appeared on Pioneer’s programs, and university faculty are on the Pioneer board of directors. The episode premiered, about Barn Quilts, features an Intellectual Community course taught by Julia Dabbs. 

The episode focuses on Stevens County’s own Ward Voorhees, who first encountered Barn Quilts in Carver County, in Southeast Minnesota. Afterward, he committed to making his own, and expanded the idea to a barn quilt trail for the whole county. He found others who had, or were willing to create, barn quilts and the trail was convened for the summer of 2018.

Barn quilts are typically adorned with geometric designs, which may sound limiting at first, but lead to a substantial diversity in ideas, shapes, and overall design. To ensure the quilts are recognizable against the buildings they are attached to, borders are utilized to set them apart. Voorhees recommends that barn quilts be constructed out of medium density overlay plywood, the same material used in transportation and road signs. 

The trail in Stevens county opened in August of 2018, with 24 quilts at 14 locations. The committee responsible had minimum requirements for being featured on the trail, including liability terms and residency time. Beyond Morris, Chokio, Donnelly, and the area in between have quilts featured on the trail. The trail is partnered with the Stevens County Historical Society for website hosting and outreach. 

Michael Cihak, part of Instructional Media Technology for the campus, is the producer of _Prairie Yard and Garden_. Along with host Mary Holm, they answered questions after the premiere relating to gardening and the production of the show. 

The production board for the show generally meets a year out from the planned air date of the next season to pick topics. Each season is split into 4 types of episode: expertise, research, and general science; gardens and personal sites; industry, agriculture, and related topics; and art, heritage, and culture. Each season ends up composed of four episodes of each type except for the latter, which is usually relegated to one. 

The production schedule runs almost the entire year. From February to May, the crew makes calls, researches topics, and arranges who they are interviewing and when they will do so. From July to August, the crew is out filming the interviews and capturing footage as B-roll to accompany the interview. From September until the premiere of the season in January, editing is being done to complete the episode. Voiceovers, transitions, sponsor placements, music, and other final touches are applied to provide a pleasing aesthetic to the content within. 

At the premiere, there was a clear love of the program and the station. Rural Minnesotans saw themselves on the screen, represented with hard work, science, and culture with roots here and in the past. The service to the community represented by Pioneer is something we could all aspire to. 
_Prairie Yard and Garden_ airs Thursdays at 7:30 PM. Episodes are hosted on YouTube on the pioneerpublic channel.
