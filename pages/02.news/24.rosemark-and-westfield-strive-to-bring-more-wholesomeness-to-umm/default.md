With student body representative elections coming up the week before spring break, students have been promoting their campaigns for student body president and vice president - one of those being the running mates of Sam Rosemark and Josh Westfield, two current MCSA secretaries looking to make the University of Minnesota Morris a more wholesome place.

Rosemark, running for student body president, is a second year political science and economics double major with a minor in environmental stewardship and sustainability.  He is an active individual on campus, taking part in MCSA as a one of the two U of M senators, a campus assembly representative, and the secretary of student services as well as being a campus tour guide.  Westfield is a third year mathematics and statistics major running for vice president alongside Rosemark.  Also taking part in the executive committee of MCSA, Westfield is the secretary for resources and operations. 

For their headline motto for their campaign, Rosemark and Westfield chose “wholesome” to represent their vision of what they want Morris to become.  They began with the literary definition of wholesome: conducive to or suggestive of good health and physical well-being and/or conducive to or promoting moral well-being.  From that, they built a platform of what believe describes the Morris community, described in five areas: wellness, equity, community, academics, and sustainability.

With wellness, physical and emotional well-being are cared for through mental health services on campus, disability resources, and food services.  Equity focuses on the diversity in the UMM system, working with Morris’ Equity, Diversity, and Intercultural Programs and the Resource Center for Gender, Women, and Sexuality.  For academics, Rosemark and Westfield look toward giving students more choices in their classes such as WLA through general education reforms.  Rosemark also stated interest in general education emphasizing Morris values such as sustainability, wellness, and Native American Indigenous studies; “Those are the three big things that should be implemented in a general education for students so they can walk away with understanding on what Morris is.”  As for sustainability, they want to continue the excellence of Morris being a national leader.

But why do Rosemark and Westfield believe they are the individuals to take on these areas?  Rosemark also believes that with their diversity in majors, different age demographic, and involvement in several campus activities, they have the foundation to be the “consensus building, unifying figure” that the president and vice president should be: “Together we can appeal and know what students go through, whether they are in STEM or more so in the soft sciences or humanities….We are involved and very passionate about being involved and being a part of the Morris community...taking these opportunities and positions to learn more about the campus, its people working in the system, and building those relationships.”

Rosemark and Westfield also encourage active engagement within their campaign by having students fill out a feedback form, found on the University of Minnesota Morris Facebook Forum.  Through this forum, Rosemark and Westfield hope to achieve two things: hearing what students like and the changes that they want to see on campus as well as having students active with the campaign. “MCSA has low membership right now and next year we want to have more students involved,” stated Rosemark.

If they were to become elected, Rosemark and Westfield want to walk away at the end of their term with the Morris community noticing the changes that they made, “The changes we want, we want them to be effective and big enough for people to know that there was change,” stated Westfield.  Rosemark again reiterated that next semester they want to see more student body participation within student government, “We don't’ care if you have any experience with student government, we want people to come to forum and help us create a wholesome UMM and represent the student voice.”

Rosemark concluded by stating that he wants people to walk away with a positive experience at Morris, “When people graduate, I want people to think ‘Dang, Morris, what a wholesome campus, what a wholesome group of people.’” And that it can be achieved through the help of two wholesome dudes.

Online voting will be held the week of March 11th and will close shortly before spring break.
