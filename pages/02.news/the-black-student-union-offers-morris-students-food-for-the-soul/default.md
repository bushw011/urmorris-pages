This year’s annual Soul Food Dinner took place in Oyate Hall and had close to 90 attendees. When the event started at 6 p.m. on February 21, the venue was decorated with formal table cloths and yellow and maroon napkins. At the head of the room was a podium with the official University of Minnesota Morris background. Next to the podium was a projector and computer used to stream music from composers such as Duke Ellington during the dinner.

The Soul Food Dinner is a part of many monthly events put on by the Black Student Union (BSU) including What is White Passing? and the Body Image Panel. The following events are Being Black vs. African, March’s Women’s Rights discussion, April’s Black Boy Joy, and finally, May’s Culture Vultures.

The event was opened by Jamie Polahn, the President of BSU, and Lexi Dant, the Vice President of BSU. They read the BSU mission statement and described the purpose of the event, “to bring campus together and bridge the gap [inside] small communities like Morris.” Dant then outlined the events for the evening, and introduced Delores Allison, who helped form the lines for dinner. The meal consisted of fried chicken, collard greens, mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, cornbread and chocolate cake. After everyone had eaten most of their meals, Dant returned to the podium to introduce Leslie Badue, the keynote speaker. Badue is the vice president of the Minneapolis chapter of NAACP. Originally, she hoped to become a judge to help serve her community, and, in particular, those who were being systematically oppressed. However, just a couple short months before graduation, she decided to leave college and promote her goals in other ways. She also studied social entrepreneurship in India.

Badue brought to light Three C’s as the focal point of her speech. Communication was the first, and she made a case for using electronic means, such as Facebook and Twitter “to build bridges, not walls.” Compassion, the second C, was described as “seeing humanity in one another.” Badue urged people to “see the people who have been oppressed and hurting for far too long.” “We all do better when we all do better.” She also advised, “Don’t run away from
conflict--run towards it.” The third C was collaboration, and Badue pointed out that “You don’t have to be Beyoncé to activate your community” and that “we have to be okay with challenging laws and challenging procedures.”

After Badue’s speech, Polhan introduced a video explaining the significance and origin of Black History Month, and allowed members of BSU to detail their experiences. Jamie Polhan, Kriss Baye, Lexi Dant, Prince Nwaonicha, an MCSA rep, and Magbah Lahai, the BSU secretary gave brief talks. The evening concluded with an original poem by Mia King, included in its entirety below: 

> You don’t know about us... a deep history rooted in hate makes me challenge my fate.
> The fate you build laughing at my shameful and predictable downfall. Lies too intricate to decipher, centuries old a story too real to talk about because of unknowing and clearly ignorant eyes, blinded by what the ears won’t hear... the screams, the cries! The last breath of my love cuz you were too scared to investigate what lies underneath his
> rich complexion only a reflection of what you see an animal, a beast. Look in the mirror questioning my beliefs sadly begging to a falsity you ingrained in me. My blood is everywhere from the ground you stand on to the skyscrapers that cloud your view of the bluest skies that I know aren’t my limits. Every inch I climb I know I’m closer to what I know others lack. Peace, happiness, and justice. I left everything else behind a pile of ashes like dead skin peeling, I have evolved found like a diamond in the rough what you and everyone else want to cover up. Take it for yourself I see how it is if the thief is stealing for hundreds of years. Wouldn’t they be confused on what made them look true? Where’s my history if you constantly write it but I forgot to look closely always fooling with the fine print you make sure I miss. But every cell, every tissue ever organ within me carries the truth like the stone tablet with the commandments. I commend you, the first to try and brush off what’s set in stone like a grave you bury yourself deeper and deeper but fill it with our bodies like cement. I lament my brothers and sisters are no longer the things you use and abuse like the many drugs that addict you because their names ring free. From the blacks that inventive, inspired and progressed for me Malcolm X, Hattie McDaniel, Josephine Baker, Shirley Chisholm, Coretta Scott King, Martin Luther King, Madame Cj Walker, Marjorie Joyner, Harriet Tubman, Ida B. Wells, Sojourner Truth, Nelson Mandela, Fredrick Douglas, Barrack Obama and Michelle Obama to the blacks that died and or suffered from police brutality, Philando Castile, Sandra Bland, Laquan McDonald Micheal Brown, Eric Garner, Paul O’Neal, Tamar Rice, Terence Crutcher, Samuel DuBose, Walter L. Scott, Bettie Jones and Quintonio Legrier
