In recognition of Women’s History Month, Morris’s Office of Equity, Diversity, and Intercultural Programs has organized a variety of events that will be held throughout
March.

“As many strides there have been, it’s still vital to celebrate the accomplishments of women today. I’m excited for this month’s programming with the intersections of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and race/ethnicity,” says the office’s director, Liz Thomson.

The theme of this year’s events for Women’s History Month is women in politics. March 3 featured a webinar with Christina Ewig from the University of Minnesota’s Twin Cities campus Humphrey School, who discussed the impact of the pandemic on employment for women of color.

A miniature film festival is scheduled for on March 13, and features a variety of themed films followed by a short discussion with faculty. March 16 will feature this month’s keynote speaker, Minnesota Supreme Court Chief Justice and Morris alum Lorie Gildea. March 29 will feature trivia.

Plans for this year’s observation started back in October, and this year’s selection was chosen in part because of the enormous role politics play in our lives. The University Register spoke with Samantha Fellers, a student worker who coordinated this year’s events, and encouraged everyone to attend.

“It’s my personal belief that it is all of our responsibility to understand the world around us and the people around us and we’re always going to have women around, and people have different genders and sexualities around us,” Fellers said.

“Learning about those people and learning about women’s history and women who are currently acting with and against the system is something that’s really, really important. I think that our lives are inherently political, especially with COVID all the politics of that, so learning about women in politics and their viewpoints and how
they have affected our history.”

In addition to the activities offered by the University, Fellers suggested that those who are interested in observing Women’s History Month are also encouraged to learn more women in politics in their own community.

“Researching your own legislators and something that I think is really, really important. I know that we have female senators and a female lieutenant governor, and I think that those women are doing some really, really important things,” she said.
