On Tuesday, December 6, University of Minnesota Morris senior Genevieve Berendt gave a presentation entitled “Silence and Scream: Women’s Options and Oppressions in Maghrebi Cinema” at 7:30 p.m. in the Cow Palace. Her presentation shared some of her research through UMM’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), which had been conducted under the mentorship of Associate Professor and French Discipline Coordinator Professor Sarah Buchanan. Berendt is a triple-major in French, Anthropology, and Medieval Studies and a minor in History. Her research with UROP examined how Maghrebi cinema explores the oppression of women within the Maghrebi culture. Maghreb, also known as Barbary, is a region in Northwest Africa that consists primarily of the countries Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria, all of which are muslim-majority states. 

The first film Berendt discussed was Les Silences Du Parais (The Silences of the Palace), a 1994 drama that explores the topics of slavery, sexual exploitation, rape, unwanted pregnancy, and abortion. The film, set in 1950’s Tunisia, follows the story of Alia, a 25-year-old woman who returns to her childhood home, a prince’s palace, where her mother Khedija works as a servant. The scene that Berendt chose to share with the audience was one where Khedija realizes she is pregnant, presumably with her master’s child. She walks into a room where a number of female servants are working. One of the servants offers her coal and Khedija has a mental breakdown, crying and screaming hate and disgust for her body. The others continue their work in silence, allowing her to vent her frustrations without interference. 

The second film Berendt discussed was Rachida, a 2002 drama/Art Film that explores the topics of terroristic violence, kidnapping, and rape. Set in 1990’s Algeria, the story follows the titular Rachida, a school teacher in the region, as she witnesses the effects that terroristic activity has on her home village. The scene Berendt shared with her audience showed a woman named Zohra running through a forest barefoot with her dress tattered to escape her captors. She enters Rachida’s village and begins pounding on doors, begging to be let inside, but to no avail. Exhausted, she falls to the ground in the center of the town square. Men attempt to calm her, but she recoils. Instead, multiple women step forward and remove their veils to place them over Zorha like a blanket. 

Berendt then reflected on the two scenes, and explained how they utilize the juxtaposition of silence and screaming to show how the women find strength in solidarity. In the first scene, the women do not attempt to console Khedija because giving her the space she needs is the best way they know how to show their support. In the second scene, the women remove their veils in a time where being seen in public without one would often lead to acts of violence. When they place their veils over Zohra’s body, it is their way of telling her that she is not alone. In both cases, Berendt believes that the women are openly defying the men who have historically had control over their lives.
