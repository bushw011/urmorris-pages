People once believed that they had to repress their sexuality, a phenomenon referred to as “sexual shame”. A new movement, called “sex positivity”, began with the second wave of the feminist movement and is working to rid today’s society of their sexual shame. On Thursday, February 1, The Peer Health Educators invited Smitten Kitten to hold a workshop on the movement at 5:00 p.m. in Imholte 109. 

Smitten Kitten began their workshop by explaining how the sex positivity movement is not simply a matter of whether or not one enjoys sex, but rather about destigmatizing sex itself. As part of the movement, Smitten Kitten has been working to move society away from abstinence-only sexual education by offering a number of classes including ones aimed at those who are “desexualized”. This includes the chronically ill, the elderly, individuals with physical disabilties, and individuals with sexually-transmitted infections. The representatives from Smitten Kitten also explained how individuals with mental disabilities have one of the highest rates of sexual abuse. It is their belief that this is due to a lack of proper sexual education. 

Much of the workshop was spent discussing the definition of consent. They explained that consent is never implied and cannot be assumed, even within the context of a relationship. This does not mean it has to be enthusiastic, it simply has to be communicated clearly. It does not even need to be verbal, such as with those with hearing impairments. When dealing with non-sober individuals, consent begins to enter a grey area. Smitten Kitten urges caution in such situations. They also informed those present that consent includes the people around you; loud sex should not be had unless the people nearby are comfortable with it. Finally, they explained that consent is rarely a simple yes or no, it is most often a conversation. This helps the participants express any mixed feelings or indecision regarding the situation. 

Smitten Kitten concluded the workshop by explaining how risk is a part of sex. However, that does not mean sex has to be scary or negative, it simply means individuals must be cautious. Specifically, the sex toy industry is not regulated in the United States and so Smitten Kitten offered a number of tips to help the consumer make wise decisions. Medical-grade silicone toys are the safest but also the priciest. However, only toys with a flared base are anal-safe Lube, on the other hand, is a “minefield”. Even if it is not toxic, it may not mix well with different body chemistries. Silicone lube may be more expensive but it lasts far longer and is of a higher quality than lube made from other substances. Water-based lube may be more natural, but it absorbs into the skin. 

Smitten Kitten was founded in 2003 and currently has a physical store in Minneapolis, Minnesota. When they first opened, their goal was to offer a store that emphasized inclusivity, body positivity, consent, the environment, ethical business practices, and acknowledging the limits of sex positivity. They uphold these values through the classes they hold, they refuse to sell a harness brand unless the product comes in various sizes, and they try their best not to shame or humiliate their customers. As their workshop came to a close, the representatives from Smitten Kitten informed those present that they offer a ten-percent discount to all students but only in their physical store.
