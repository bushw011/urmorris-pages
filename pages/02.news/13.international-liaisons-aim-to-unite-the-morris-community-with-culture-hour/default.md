It is no surprise that the University of Minnesota Morris embraces it multi-cultural, multi-ethnic population.  In celebration of the university’s diversity, international liaisons Shafiul Umam and Sudi Sun bring to campus Culture Hour, an hour dedicated to informing audience members about the different cultures and ethnicities that thrive in the Morris community.  

Umam and Sun’s personal input to create their version of Culture Hour revolved around the question of “what would get us engaged as well”?   After brainstorming, they found that Buzzfeed content such as “6 Japanese Street Styles That’ll Blow Your Mind” or “People Try Mexican Street Food” from Youtube provides interest to an audience while also educating them about a culture besides their own.  They thought that since this format of videos is popular on the internet, why not make it into something live on campus?

When given the task to create a cultural platform, Umam and Sun pitched their idea of a live, informational show with “9 Things We Didn’t Expect When We First Came To America,” an idea they pitched to other international mentors about what it was like when they first came to America their freshman year at Morris.  With great success, they worked with the international mentors with the program, following up with involving students from both the Gateway and STELLAR programs over the past summer.

When asked what they enjoyed most about seeing Culture Hour come together throughout the summer and the past couple weeks of the school year, Umam and Sun stated that they enjoyed the passion, enthusiasm, and the level of interest surrounding the events.  Sun states that for her, Culture Hour is a matter of sharing one's culture with another; “Culture Hour is for someone who wants to share their culture with someone who doesn’t know about it.”  A future goal that they both have is to involve members of the Morris community itself to either present or just sit in on the presentations, “I feel that the town community is disconnected from the different perspectives there are [on campus], things our student body has to offer...We can be a good entry point to extending the interactions, giving them a fun platform for them to come and engage with the students,” stated Umam.  They also hope to expand past presentations and have more interactive activities for students and community members alike to be involved in.

Umam and Sun also give thanks to the colleagues and mentors who worked with them in STELLAR and Gateway who have set examples by sharing their cultural experiences that contributed to the development of what Culture Hours are today and to be in the future. “We would've not come as far as we did without their inspiring company and example leadership. They gave us the pioneering example that paved the way for us to develop our expectations as we look towards future Cultural Hours,” stated Umam.

As for future Culture Hour events, the topics covered can vary based on student and community member interest in presenting.  Umam and Sun are always looking for enthusiastic people willing to share their experiences for future Culture Hours.  They are also willing to aid individuals or groups to curate and guide Culture Hour topics, formats, and deliveries.

Future events include a language table to take place during November and a mock Chinese entrance exam, formally called the Gaokao, to happen around finals week in December.  Culture Hour takes place in the Turtle Mountain Cafe, so keepan eye out for posters and Facebook notifications regarding future Culture Hour dates and topics.
