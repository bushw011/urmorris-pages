On Monday, February 26, the Morris Queer Student Initiative for Equality (MoQSIE) held a Pride Week Social at 7:00 p.m. in Louie’s Lower Level. Representatives from MoQSIE were present to provide those in attendance a schedule of the events they had planned throughout Pride Week as well as free tomato soup, grilled cheese sandwiches, and numerous board games including Heartthrob the Dream Date Game, Girl Talk, and Cards Against Humanity. 

Adrienne Conley, Assistant Director for Student Life and Coordinator for LGBTQIA2S+ Programs, was present at the social and informed The University Register that the event was only the second of three socials MoQSIE holds throughout the year. “It’s a good time for our students to come together and share in community,” she said. She continued to explain that, even though Pride is officially in the summer, it has become a tradition in Morris to take a week to celebrate LGBTQIA2S+ pride as a community. 

“I just think it’s really nice to get together with LGBTQ people and students because in my home town, we never have real get-togethers,” CJ Lee, a queer student at The University of Minnesota, Morris, told The University Register. “It’s nice to be out and proud about something that for decades was forbidden...it’s been straight pride for the past 100 years. We deserve some time in the light because we’ve been ostracized for so long.”
