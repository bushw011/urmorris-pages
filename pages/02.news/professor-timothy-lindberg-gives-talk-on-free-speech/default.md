Free Speech 101: College Campuses took place in the McGinnis room on the bottom floor of the library at 7 p.m. Twenty-three people were in attendance.

Peter Bremer opened the event and posed the discussion topic on how free speech impacts college campuses.

Tim Lindberg, a political science professor, presented his slideshow about free speech both in general as well as on college campuses. One slide read, “Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech…” which Lindberg said applies only as a government restriction meaning that private entities may treat speech differently, or at their own leisure. Lindberg also pointed out that there are other countries that have speech that is even more free than the United States while others apply certain and specific rules. For example, in some countries it is not acceptable to deliver Nazi propaganda.

Freedom of speech in the United States is also a complicated subject legally as there are many vague laws and exceptions to consider. Take, for example, the ‘fighting words’ law which was implemented in 1942 and has almost no practical use in modern cases. Further complicating this set of laws is R.A.V. v.s. St. Paul (1992), which ruled that symbolic speech, e.g. signs, shirts, armbands, and headbands, are protected under the first amendment. However, Lindberg told those in attendance that “trying to incite immediate lawless action is not protected.”

That being said, not all ideas are good ideas. Free speech is designed so that “good ideas boil to the top,” according to Lindbergh. This method of displaying ideas and sharing them keeps the government from being able to promote certain ones. Well, maybe it makes it slightly more difficult. The government can, “only limit where there is a real threat of danger, and has no substantive value. That’s a very high bar,” Lindbergh explains.

Free speech on college campuses was also explored in depth. “These communities strive for inclusiveness, civility, debate,” Lindbergh said. He also explained that faculty and students are protected by academic freedom. However, there’s no real definite way to do this and, as a result, it often falls onto the shoulders of teachers and administrators. “Administrators try to uphold equality and defend free speech, and aren’t necessarily equipped to do either,” Lindberg said. Teachers are often prepared to teach and not specifically prepared or trained to uphold the First Amendment. At the same time, though, teachers must make sure that they do not commit their own infractions, such as holding an audience captive for a grade while preaching hate speech.

Hate speech codes take on their own meaning in university situations as it is possible for organizations and businesses to require a certain code of conduct from their students. However, hate speech codes have been met with heavy resistance, along with drawing light to potential flaws. Many point out that hate speech codes are unconstitutional, vague, and are liable to go overboard. Consequences can also be excessively harsh. Instead of hate speech codes, it has been suggested that universities instead judge students on conduct as opposed to ideas, to err on the side of supporting free speech, and if a punishment is needed, that it should be given by a neutral party.

That being said, there are methods of retaliation against hate speech that are perfectly legal. Public shunning is legal. Better than shunning, though is discussion. Explaining why one might consider certain speech ‘hate speech’ is crucial to letting the good ideas float to the top.

The floor was then opened up to questions, and ended shortly thereafter.
