The Morris city council gathered over Zoom for their biweekly meeting on Tuesday Oct. 13. They discussed the potential demolition of Morris Floral, the flower shop located on the corner of Atlantic Avenue and Second Street. The meeting ended with a resolution for the city to come up with a solution by Dec. 12 — 60 days.

The city inspector reported that in order to find issues, he did not have to look far. There is misplaced siding, gaps in insulation between the inner and outer walls, and holes in the roof that are beyond repair.

“It’s at the end of its life,” said city manager Blaine Hill.

The council discussed what to do next: potential funding options, approximate dates, and possible help for Morris Floral owner Chris Melberg. Mayor Sheldon Giese expressed a desire to not order Melberg to demolish the shop, but to allow him to do it when he could.

“It leaves a bad taste in my mouth that we’d order him to demolish the building,” Giese said.

The plan that they came up with is to research funding options for rehabilitation of the corner, and decide what to do from there.

A GoFundMe page was created to help Melberg raise money to relocate his shop. To donate, visit: gofundme.com/morris-floral-shop-relocation
