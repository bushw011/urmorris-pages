An open forum was held at 6 p.m. on Sunday, November 19 in Imholte 109. The forum, titled “Join the Discussion”, was put on by a number of students who made it clear that they were not representative of any student organizations, but were officiating the event as individuals. Nearly fifty people were in attendance.

Before the event began, the moderators, Keyah Stone, Parker Smith, and Ashiqul Alam Salvi put up guidelines on the board. “Raise your hand,” and, “stick to the point.” Salvi also pushed the panel to avoid talking about specific people. The moderators outlined the purpose of the event, which was to produce a clear and concise way to deal with the defacing of posters and other issues happening recently on campus. Bridget Peterson outlined some of the problems, including anonymously posted ‘It’s okay to be white’ posters, and a swastika drawn on the chalkboard in Louie’s Lower Level. A Native American smudge was led by Keyah Stone to start the event.

Ruby Mae Debellis, the first speaker, said that the chancellor’s response letter to these campus events was inadequate. Katrine Sjovold agreed, and added that there didn’t seem to have been any consequences for the actions taken. Bridget Peterson said that they would like to see admittance from the University that the letter was inadequate.

Bill Biggerstaff said that forcing the University to produce a response would play into the perpetrators’ hands, and make the University look bad. Sierra Dawn Brown replied that a stronger response on the behalf of the University would strengthen the community and that it would not necessarily harm it.

Molly Shoop said, “I think the letter should have addressed all parts of the issue… It is the position, I think, of this University to explicitly say, ‘This is Nazi symbolism and, ‘we’re not going to tolerate it as a campus’ instead of sort of skirting and taking this very marketing-safe approach.

No matter what the cause of the swastikas drawn in Louie’s Lower Level was, “There is nothing to be gained from this Nazi symbolism, and to not take that kind of approach to it would be to not [use] the advice that Hitler himself gave on how to avoid this sort of thing. If you were to read [about it] he said, he believed that the only way to destroy Nazi propaganda and to keep it from rising again was to completely oppose it at its initial introduction to a community whether through violence or through rhetoric of your own to make it very clear that it is not okay.”
Biggerstaff cited the example of the University of Missouri, a college which faced similar problems that resulted in a statement and said that the response to Mizzou’s cracking down on hate speech resulted in a witch hunt. “Whoever put that up is not necessarily a Nazi. There are people who get a great knee jerk reaction to the response to that.”
Matthew Sheets was quick to point out that, “The stats that the school is getting should not be a concern. Our concern should be the wellbeing of our students.”

Peter Truckenmiller followed up by explaining that the original intent of drawing swastikas is irrelevant. “These are not made with good intentions.”

Karyssa Scheck confirmed that “It’s Okay to be White” posters have previously been connected to white supremacist groups and commented on the “It’s Okay to be Muslim/Immigrant” signs that have been torn up and thrown away on campus.

Stone brought up the history of Morris in connection to racist acts, most notably the 1993 incident where Morris students “dressed up as KKK members and took two black students to see burning crosses.” Stone also suggested that posters should not be able to be posted anonymously.

Biggerstaff questioned what a suitable punishment would be for offensive posters, and Sjovold replied that the conduct code would be able to cite violations.

Kara Black said that many posters were put up near cameras, and added that, “With swastikas and ‘It’s okay to be white’ posters it doesn’t matter what the person who put those up intended...Whether the person who put those up holds those beliefs or not they still have the effect of normalizing white supremacy and supporting and reinforcing those beliefs in the people who do hold them.” Black went on to speak about how the posters impact others and spoke about how the priority of the case should be the safety of others. “I have friends who have received death threats because of their gender or their sexuality [while] on this campus from other students on this campus, and these posters support those ideologies that made those threats happen”

Elsi Wilson said, “Making people think twice about what they write on walls is not unreasonable.”
Christian Pfeiffer brought up the Board of Regents policy and read several possible violations. “Disruption of Educational Environment,” “Harm to Person,” and “Bullying.” “Warning,” “suspension,” “revocation of housing,” as well as “revocation of admission or degree” are also listed as possible sanctions, he added.

Jessica Gardner talked about an organization called FIRE, which rates freedom of speech on college campuses. “We have a red rating, which is the worst.” Jessica said. “It doesn’t take a lot to say you’re targeting someone.” (Writer’s note: as of November 16, 2017 FIRE’s website gives the University of Minnesota Morris a Speech Code Rating of Yellow, their intermediate rating.)

Shoop specified that it would be a good idea for someone impartial within the administration to collect names of those who put up the posters instead. “There are posters set up that advertise without irking others,” Shoop said, and also suggested more routine checks for outdated posters.

Peter Truckenmiller called for disciplinary action rather than exposing the names of those who put up posters to the campus.

Izzy Bearmirez drew attention to the Green Dot program for inference: “We have Green Dot because we think it’s important for people to understand about consent,” and continued to talk about implementing a similar program for racism.

Biggerstaff argued that showing who put up the posters would only serve to target unpopular ideas on campus, and that ideas should be the main concern, not who put them up. He argued, “I do believe it has been made perfectly clear today that these actions put forth here are, in fact, acts to target unpopular political ideas here on this campus...Anonymous posting, in regards to the freedom of speech at the very least, is intended to protect unpopular ideas. It should not matter whose it is, it should matter what the idea is. In the marketplace of ideas, it will sink if it is an unpopular idea. If you genuinely believe that it will not, then I pity you.” Bill then went on to speak about the idea of installing cameras, saying it would affect everyone equally, whereas non-anonymous posting “disproportionately affects political minorities and unpopular ideas on this campus. It does not matter if you deem those ideas hateful or not, it does not matter if they are actually hateful or not.” At this point, Matthew Sheets wondered aloud: “Is hate speech politics?” Biggerstaff continued, “I will make it perfectly clear that the campus has taken direct inaction in regards to the blatant discrimination and harassment of political minorities on this campus,” citing an op-ed article from The University Register from November 1, 2017, that he said called for discrimination against several students. [The article Biggerstaff refers to here was submitted to The University Register by Students for a Democratic Society, and was titled “White Nationalist Speaks at Twin Cities Campus, Morris Students in Attendance.”]

From here, Jessica Gardner took the floor, saying “If you are going to say something is racist, I think that the first step, before you even go forth is what do you define as racist? Some people said we need to know when these posters are put up so there can be an investigation… If I put up posters that said ‘build the wall’ some people might call that racist, and so there should be an investigation then and every other time? I think that’s really impractical….  The problem you guys are looking at is: ‘We need to stop racism.’ You think that an educational class is going to stop trolls from drawing swastikas? Is that what you think it’s going to accomplish?”

Salvi gave closing remarks and clarified that the document shown was a draft and will be worked on in the coming weeks. The event officially closed at 7:30 p.m., half an hour after the anticipated end.
