When you enter a space, have you ever felt like you did not belong? The latest elder-in-residence hopes you did.

As this semester’s elder-in-residence, the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Intercultural Exchange hosted Roxanne Delille, a Dean at Fond-du-Lac Tribal and Community College. She sat in on courses related to her field of study, Speech and Communications, and Indigenous Studies, hosted a workshop, was honored over dinner, and gave a prayer on her last morning. 

Her workshop on November 1, “Teaching and Learning Across Differences,” aimed at faculty and staff, taught about pedagogical tools for engaging students across cultures, identities, races, life experiences, and knowledge systems. Pedagogy, the method and practice of teaching, should be of interest to everyone, considering the tensions that define our diversifying nation. 

To frame the lecture to follow, DeLille talked about how indigenous leaders made decisions, where they made themselves of a mind and heart with their people and the land. Decisions required everyone’s consent, not just those of a majority. 

Next, DeLille asked everyone to draw an “Indian.” She encouraged people to draw something, no matter how limited or crude. Once she was confident that everyone had drawn something, she projected 18 pictures of three people dressed in different outfits. Some of the outfits implied racial stereotypes, such as hoodies, cultural garb, and one prison uniform. Others were professional or neutral in nature. 

She asked people whether they had drawn a typical “feather-wearing Indian” or something more neutral. She challenged the audience to see that “Indian” carried bias; that clothing, a necessity and important part of identity, carried bias. People do not control their implicit biases, but all the same, they are barriers to understanding others. The challenge she issued to the audience is to recognize their bias, and how it was impacting the way they taught others. 

DeLille stressed that bias has consequences for those being judged. In her personal experience, she has been called a bad leader for the way she forms consensus: rather than go with the majority, she fights for total consensus, and barring that, allows the group to have all the options she gives. For a historical perspective, many indigenous parents had their children taken because indigenous kids were considered unruly or because the parents were not using enough punitive discipline. 

The educators in the room, DeLille assumed, were likely carry to an institutional mindset, believing what they say to be true. This bias raises the question: as educators, is the goal to assimilate or to educate? Educators must be willing to place themselves in the mindset of what makes themselves the same as their students, and what makes them different. 
DeLille raised a distinction between cultural competency and cultural humility. Competency tries to extrapolate from one experience to build competency in service providers, while humility raises awareness and builds reflection in service providers about their understandings to be better providers. Humility is meant to be a lifelong learning process, cultivating openness, critical self-reflection, and balance power. 

DeLille then split the audience into three roughly equal groups for an exercise. She instructed attendees to write three things that make you different from those in your group. Being the only student in the audience, I thought I could do this easily. For my first, I wrote “no professional degree;” the workshop being directed at the administration and faculty made this one a given. Leaning on my youthful status, I wrote “understanding of modern interaction with the internet.” It was a bit questionable, since in an academic sense, modern meant a long enough span of time for professors to grasp the old Impact font memes from the golden age, but my group let it slide. Next, I tried out “friend of Ed Brands,” but then I considered how strong that language is and crossed it out. Returning to my student status, I wrote “Only one with classes from [three people in my group and a mentee of a fourth].” 

Once we started sharing, my sense of difference was confirmed. But for them, they all found something relatable in each other’s choices. One person claimed to like snakes, which another in the group revealed they did as well. Another person claimed to have a plant-centric cosmology, which someone else claimed to have, but the latter noted that they are likely to come from different places in their understandings. 

These were just a few of the differences my group shared, and they illustrated DeLille’s next point well: that subtle differences and same differences have a unique character. People should refrain from cutting off discussion when differences are the focus, as doing so imposes their version of that difference on others. Being humble instead allows for the opportunity to learn. 

DeLille then broke down the aspects of practicing cultural humility: 

Embracing uncertainty, starting from recognizing yourself as different, as the outsider. As you cannot know the perspectives, worldviews, or experiences of others with certainty, you must remain humble. 

Cultivate awareness, with three specific types: self awareness, where you recognize your own biases, prejudices, and stereotypes; other awareness, where you accept how others see themselves; power awareness, where you recognize and balance power. 

Lastly, cultivate genuine curiosity, where you reserve judgement. This involves asking respectful questions, owning your lack of knowledge, opening with permission to ask, and giving some of your own difference to learn about others’. 

DeLille was assured of her knowledge, having honed it by teaching across cultures herself. Earlier in the lecture, she introduced a continuum of traditional vs. contemporary values. Even with all her experience, she did not fall totally in the traditional camp, and never in the contemporary camp. Flexibility has enriched her teaching experience, and cultural humility is its bedrock.
