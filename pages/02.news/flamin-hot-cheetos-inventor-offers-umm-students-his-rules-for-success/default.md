At 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday, March 28 in Edson Auditorium, Richard Montañez, inventor of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos and currently the Executive Vice President of Multicultural Sales and Community Activation for PepsiCo North America, gave a keynote speech as a part of World Touch Cultural Heritage Week. The keynote began with an introduction to Richard Montañez that was read in both English and Spanish.

“I needed to be here,” Montañez told his audience once he took the stage. “There’s somebody here who needs to hear what I have to say... when you love yourself, you have the freedom to be yourself.” He continued by explaining how an individual does not need permission to be great. He explained how, as a child, he was “never going to be anybody” because he had never been invited. Montañez grew up in a small town in California where everyone picked grapes for a living. He was raised in a one-room apartment where the kitchen was shared by ten different families and the bathrooms were outdoors. 

Montañez shared a story of a time when his mother found him crying in his room. He explained how he was forced to move from a Spanish-speaking school to an English-speaking one at a young age. On the first day, he and his friends waited at the bus stop but the yellow bus never arrived. It was an ugly green bus that came to pick them up. Montañez explained how he learned later that the Spanish-speaking children were forced to ride the green bus so they could be paraded around the town to show that they were not good enough to ride the yellow bus. It was then that Montañez decided he did not want to be the person who was paraded around and humiliated. He then explained how he and his group of friends could not understand the English-speaking teacher and chose to sit together at all times. During lunch, he found a burrito in his lunch box and was embarrassed because none of the other children, not even his Spanish-speaking friends, had a burrito for lunch. So when his mother asked him why he was crying, he yelled at his mother that he did not want to be different. His mother told him that he could not help being different because it was who he was. So the next day she gave him two burritos: one for himself and one for a friend. “Maybe there’s something special about being different,” Montañez said to the students who had gathered to hear his speech. “As much as I want to fit in, I wasn’t created to fit in. I was created to stand out.” 

Later in life, he dropped out of school and got a job butchering chickens at a local farm. He had only just gotten married when he was notified of a job opening as a janitor at the local Frito-Lay facility. He turned in an application and was hired on the spot. To this day, Montañez remarks that he “thanks God” for their lack of background checks. He recalls a time when he told his family about his new job and his grandfather told him, “When you mop that floor, you make sure it shines and people know a Montañez did it.” 

Montañez moved on to say that one should never think that a raise makes them a better worker. Instead, one should strive to always be that better worker. He told a story of a time when his friends at the job asked him what he wanted to be. “Vice President,” he told them. They all laughed, but it had never been a joke to him. 

At a company meeting, a video from the CEO of Frito-Lay told them to “act like owners.” While his friends shook their heads at the words, they only inspired Montañez. The next week, he spent his days off riding into town with the salesman to sell their product at the local market. As he was helping unload the product from the truck, Montañez had what he called a “revelation.” He spotted a number of spice racks and had the idea to put chili on Cheetos. He and his wife made enough for him and his friends at work, all of whom pushed him to go to the CEO with his idea. 

The next day, he used the secretary’s phone to call the regional CEO. After he shared his idea, the CEO informed Montañez that he would visit the plant Montañez worked at. Once the plant manager found out that Montañez had called, he was furious and forced Montañez to deliver a formal presentation before a board of executives. Worried that he was about to get fired, Montañez and his wife went to their local library to study a number of books on management. They also made over a hundred bags of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos in preparation. 

Once it came time for the presentation, he found himself amazed by his own composure. “I was actually doing it,” Montañez told his audience as though he were still in disbelief. “I had their attention.” He then interrupted his narrative to explain to those present that the strongest antidote to fear was hunger. As he stood before the room of executives, he was “hungry for a change in [his] life.” 

Since then, he has been responsible for the creation of several original products and was even invited to the White House. He told the story of the first time he ever flew in a plane, which was a private jet owned by the company. At the time, he had been so nervous that he paid no attention to which seat he sat in. Upon landing, a friend of his who had been on the plane with him and the other executives informed him that he had chosen to sit in the seat of the CEO. On the flight back, he cried. It was a voice in his head that made him realize that everyone on the plane knew he had chosen the seat of the CEO and yet none of them had spoken a word of it to him during the flight. And he knew it was because they respected him. 

As his speech drew to a close, he told his audience that “all you need is one revelation.” It is his strong belief that it is this one revelation that will lead to success. “Achieve success so you can share it with others,” were his closing remarks, “That’s how you know you’ve made it.”
