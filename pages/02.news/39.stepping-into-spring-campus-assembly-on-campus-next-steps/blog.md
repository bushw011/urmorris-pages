With the fall semester coming to a close, the Campus Assembly came together Tuesday, December 2 during community hour to discuss the University of Minnesota Morris’ next steps leading into the new year.

According to the university’s official website, the Campus Assembly is “[campus’] most visible, college-wide symbol of shared governance. Reflecting UMM’s traditions and commitments, it is inclusive, with representatives from all campus-based constituencies: faculty, both regular and part-time; academic staff; students; and civil service and bargaining unit employees. It is both a forum for deliberation and a site for action.” The assembly meets every other Tuesday during community hour and is open to the campus community.

The assembly opened up with a welcome and past business summary from Chancellor Behr at 11:40 p.m.. She began with an update from the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) visit regarding the University’s accreditation. Recently, the university received a report of errors that were found by the HLC and they are given a week to work on those errors, returning the amended report to the dean chair of the HLC. The public results will not be released until next April. 

Behr also strongly emphasized the progress of the Strategic Visioning and Planning, reviewing the summer and spring progress of student retention and participation as well as improving the campus climate. She also preluded to the next focus of well-being and improving inclusion of Native cultures within the campus community; the Strategic Visioning and Planning page on the Morris website states this as “Recognizing the unique obligation and opportunity at UMN Morris for greater equity in education for Native American students fostered by the history of this place; provide indigenized support for student learning, health, wellbeing, and success; and produce graduates from all backgrounds who have a greater understanding of and appreciation for Native American history, cultures, and lifeways.”

Behr concluded by thanking the assembly for committing time and energy to the Strategic Visioning and Planning initiative, saying that each step is valuable to creating a valuable liberal arts education: “I cannot overestimate the progress we are making to build [the university’s] future.”

The meeting moved to approving the minutes, to which all assembly members approved. 

The Commission of Women and Gender Equity discussed the improvements of their Equity, Diversity, and Adversity (EDA) pilot program that was approved in spring 2018 and started in fall 2018. The program was created for the increasing diverse student body and works toward connecting different areas and divisions in order to increase inclusivity in and out of the classroom. Data regarding EDA training among staff, retention of information, and overall outcomes of the pilot since fall 2018 was collected. The overall statistics from the data showed that, on average, faculty took EDA training 2.88 times. The next step is looking for qualitative data such as creating community capacity and systemic changes. Overall, participants of the training found the information valuable in order to connect with and understand the students in a non-judgemental, diverse atmosphere.

The next group to present was the Strategic Enrollment Management Planning Committee with an update on the website created by Jenna Ray of the Office of Communication and Marketing. The committee mostly discussed the results given by the HLC regarding accreditation and enrollment and how to move forward with the data that was given. The goal is to draft several enrollment goals before the HLC’s next visit in January to go over revisions with the accreditation.

Lastly, the Student Affairs Committee discussed amendments to the public university poster regulations and the state of the tunnel’s poster strip. The committee spoke on a proposal to remove the poster strip and putting several Let’s Thrive posters and student work (art, projects, etc.) in its place. Work on amending poster regulations is to be a longer process, according to the committee, stating that the process could take up to the next school year. Proposals for the revisions will be brought to the assembly when they are drafted.

Behr then dismissed the Assembly at 12:40 p.m.
