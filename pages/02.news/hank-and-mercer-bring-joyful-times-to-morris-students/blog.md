The Morris therapy dog program was started by Kara Budreau almost two and a half years ago. It features golden retrievers Hank and Mercer, who are brought in on a regular basis by the elementary counselor, Tammy Roth. The therapy dogs arrive weekly on Wednesday. at 5 p.m
Therapy dog teams (human and dog) must go through several sets of testing before they are allowed to practice. The dogs must be very well behaved, open to being touched by many different people, and should also seek out being touched by others. The trainers have their own set of tests as well. Trainers need to be able to read their dogs’ body language, which includes picking up on stress signs such as the stress shakes and yawns, various types of licking, and play bows. The relationship between owner and dog must also be very good, with a healthy amount of trust.

Mercer, who Roth says really likes belly rubs, is the oldest therapy dog within the Morris program at ten years old. Golden  retrievers are commonly used as therapy dogs because of their friendly temperaments, though border collies and German shepherds are also used. Mercer’s first job was through the Mercer County’s Sheriff’s Office in North Dakota as a drug sniffing dog. Though Mercer enjoyed working at the sheriff’s office, he eventually became too old and was forced to retire. Tammy Roth found Mercer through her brother who worked in the same department, and adopted the dog shortly thereafter.

Hank is one of Mercer’s many sons. At two years old, he is more energetic than Mercer, but he is also the pick of his litter. As early as his first two weeks of life, he was closely monitored and selected to be the most likely of his litter to succeed as a therapy dog, though many of his siblings also followed the same path.

The weekly therapy dog meetings have an attendance of about ten regulars who come every week, followed by many more drop-ins. Though the meetings are less attended at the start of the school year, attendance rises steadily before growing rapidly for finals week. Sometimes, when more people are expected, Klara, another one of Mercer’s offspring stops by for a visit.
	
If you have time, Roth encourages you to visit with Hank and Mercer before the end of the year, saying they would love to see you. If you simply do not have the time, you can also see the dogs on either of their Facebook pages.
