Contact tracing and isolation are critical tools to prevent the spread of COVID-19, but many students are not familiar with isolation procedures and very few people have experienced them first hand. Here is a general overview; every student is advised to put together a contingency plan with their family, roommates, etc. regarding what to do if they need to isolate. After being exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or after showing possible symptoms, students should immediately isolate themselves and contact health services or their healthcare provider to arrange a test at Stevens Community Medical Center. Students living on campus are put into “Cougar Care,” special on-campus housing spaces, and students living off-campus are advised to stay inside and not interact with anyone they may be living with. 

Before moving forward, there is also some important vocab. Using the vernacular applied by the University, students with a confirmed test “isolate,” while students who have not had a positive test “quarantine.” This section uses both words interchangeably, but both students we spoke to tested negative and were officially in “isolation.” Students who test negative are encouraged to ”quarantine as directed by health care professionals and public health officials,” and based on who we have spoken with, these isolation periods typically last for approximately ten days. You can go through all of the information publicly available regarding isolation and still have some questions, so we spoke with students who had experienced isolating—both on and off campus—to learn about their experiences.

Gabrielle Holboy is a first year student who stayed in Cougar Care from Aug. 26 to Sept. 4 after experiencing flu-like symptoms.

"I woke up and I felt miserable. I could tell I had a fever and I was coughing,” Holboy said. She ended up calling SCMC to schedule a COVID test and contacted health services a short time later. Within a few hours of waking up she had packed a bag and was moved into Cougar Care. “I had to call a couple times and then someone from housing came and gave me my keys. My roommate helped me bring a bag and [then] it was just walking over to the apartment to get situated.
    
”Once she was in isolation, it took some time for Holboy to get her test results back. “I got tested at noon on Wednesday, and I got a voicemail at 8pm Friday morning.” Based on her knowledge, nobody she was in contact with was contacted by health services or placed in isolation. “They told me my roommate she didn’t need to isolate in her room, and that she should just check herself as normal, which was concerning to me because at the time it was a very real possibility that I had COVID.”

Cougar Care itself seems to occupy upperclassmen on-campus apartment blocks. In Holboy’s case there was not much beyond what would be found in a vacant apartment. “It was like a standard dorm setup.” The apartment had “a living room with a kitchen, stove, fridge and a microwave, bathroom, and bunk beds.” She says she did not have much of an idea what to expect from the space. “I was told there would be pillows and blankets there so I didn’t have to bring that and then I got there and there weren’t any.” She said overall, “they just told me to pack anything you think you're going to need for 10 to 14 days.” Residential life did provide some basic sanitary items. “The only thing they provided really was toilet paper and tiny bottles of shampoo and body wash. [They] gave me a mask, as well as hand sanitizer,” Holboy said.

While isolating, Holboy would talk with friends over FaceTime, but the only in-person contact she had was when someone delivered her food. “Someone would knock on the patio doors that they have in the back and you have to wait like ten to fifteen seconds for them to get out of the area and then you open the door, and then you grab it off the deck so they don't have to go inside the building at all,” she said. “I ended up shaping my day around that, which I think is the biggest way I changed while in Cougar Care, because the most exciting time of day for me was when I could see a person through the window.” All food was sourced from what the dining hall had served either that day or the day before, and selection was very limited.

Taking classes online was more challenging while other students were attending them in person. “For one of my classes it was pretty hard because a professor hadn't figured out Zoom so I couldn't hear anything that was happening in class and she'd have to repeat everything. Then in another class, I just didn't go for two weeks because the professor said he didn't know how to work Zoom so he just sent us the slides.”

Despite the challenges, Holboy was able to make it through her time in Cougar Care “it was kind of a miserable time and I kind of just don't want to think about it.” She had pleasant interactions with staff members but “it seemed like they had too much on their plate.” She said she understands that this is a difficult time, but wishes information about quarantining could be communicated more clearly with students. 

Our off-campus student wishes to remain anonymous in order to protect their personal privacy. Like everyone else in the pandemic, they seemed to be making the best of a tough situation, but isolation certainly has not been easy. “I think people don't understand, there's just a lot of added stressors. Right now it's a lot better than it was when I first started my isolation. But like, I was seriously on the phone with Stevens County medical center during a class trying to set up my COVID test.” 

Thankfully, they were able to get tested and the results came back negative. They reported that getting tested was not incredibly challenging. They said, “I think I have taken for granted the quality medical care that I received my entire life, and results just come back slower up here.” 

However, questions did arise when it came to how to self-isolate. “[It’s] kind of hard to navigate from a student perspective,” they said. “Nobody really answers the question of why, or to what extent you need to be isolating.” 

The CDC outlined guidelines to prevent the virus, instructing people to continue to quarantine, even if they are asymptomatic and have received a negative COVID-19 test. “It sucks right now because I did test negative and I still have to get through the rest of my quarantine, even though it would be way easier for me to learn if I could just go to class on Thursday,” they said.

Although they were not infected with the virus, they are concerned about the stigma attached to being in isolation and the medical privacy of students. “When you come in through Zoom and you're the only person doing it, it just feels like you got a red letter A on your chest,” they said. “It might be a good idea for admin to have a conversation with professors about what's acceptable and what's not… I've had two professors ask me if I have tested positive for COVID in front of other people, you know?I know people are like, you have to quarantine because you were doing something bad, like you were having this rager, but for me it was just an innocent [normal interaction] that ended up being an exposure.”

Classes under quarantine are also more difficult. “I think as a university we're prepared for where we are right now and we're kind of prepared for if we have to go completely online, but I don't think professors are prepared for having some students in isolation and having other students not in isolation… A lot of my hybrid classes right now don't have well set up zoom options. I basically just have to listen to the lecture and I don't get to participate at all and it's not the most equitable thing.”

Despite all these difficulties, they remain optimistic about the future. When they began isolating, they thought that a return to online classes was inevitable, but as time passed their perspective changed. “If everyone stays here right now and [people isolating] finish their quarantines, I feel like we might stand a decent chance on our little island in the middle of nowhere.”
