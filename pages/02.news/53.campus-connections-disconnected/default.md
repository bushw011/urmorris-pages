Throughout the semester, student organization leaders have been notified about an impending switch to a new Campus Connections system sometime during the Fall. On Oct. 12, the student leaders finally received invitations to their respective organizations’ sites on Presence - the new Campus Connections system.

While the transfer was not yet complete, and an important date was still missing from the website, Senior Director of Student Activities Dave Swenson said that the process would be complete the following Friday.

When Friday afternoon came on Oct. 16, Swenson sent an email to the org leaders with an update that led with, “Hello Student Leaders, unfortunately, I write to you with less than positive news.” Swenson then went on to explain that the system was still experiencing technical difficulties and that student activities were doing everything in their power to resolve the issues and make the system operational as soon as possible. The switch between systems has led to lukewarm reception from some student organization leaders.

MoQSiE’s MCSA representative, Kara Black, was frustrated with the website’s visual design choices. “Nothing stands out as important, it isn’t clear what things can and can’t be clicked on, and the whole thing is just flat out ugly.” Black also mentioned that some officer positions were not transferred correctly. “One club I have been an officer of for three years, I now have no access at all. On the other hand, I am now apparently the president of a club I’m not sure I was even a member of.”

KUMM program director, Cal Mergendahl, focused their frustrations with the program on the functionality. “I can’t view rosters, can’t send out emails, and have no real idea how to run forms.” Mergendahl then expressed sympathy for other campuses, who have also made the leap from Campus Connections to Presence. “If this is the amount of functionality we are getting out of this with student activities and IT working around the clock to try and soften the landing, I shudder to think what it looks like on other campuses that didn’t have that cushion.”

Mariah Thesing, a student activities office assistant, said that Presence was a pain, but ensured that student activities are doing their best to work on it. “I understand people’s frustration and irritation with the transfering over [of organization data], but as the office assistants, we have had to transfer everything manually and we are doing our best.” Thesing described the process that the office assistants had to work on last week, in which they had to manually enter individual student information themselves.

Overall, despite the lukewarm launch, it seems as though Office of Student Activities is confident that Presence will be a robust, user-friendly system that surpasses the capabilities and functionality of its predecessor.
