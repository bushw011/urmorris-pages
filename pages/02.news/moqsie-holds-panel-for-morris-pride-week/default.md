On Tuesday, February 27, the Morris Queer Student Initiative for Equality (MoQSIE) held a discussion panel for Morris Pride Week at 7:00 p.m. in Imholte 112. Four speakers arrived to take part in the discussion: Andrew Stansbury, Assistant Professor at the University of Minnesota Morris (UMM); Demcie Mesteth, a student at UMM and director of MoQSIE’s annual drag show; Mia King, a student at UMM; and Peh H. Ng, Professor of Mathematics and Division Chair of Science and Mathematics at UMM. Maija Kittleson, a representative of MoQSIE, was present to ask the speakers various questions regarding LGBTQIA2S+ Pride (hereafter referred to as “pride”) and their personal experiences with it. 

Kittleson began the panel by asking the speakers what came to mind when they thought of Pride. Professor Ng was the first to respond with a simple “empowerment.” Stansbury then answered, “Pride for me...represents a moment for us to come together and act as family.” Mesteth described Pride as being “the conscious bravery to exist.” 

King and Mesteth quickly agreed that their personal concepts of pride expanded beyond the queer aspects of their identities to incorporate their ethnic backgrounds. King explained how, growing up, she saw her sexuality as a burden, electing not to acknowledge that aspect of her identity. She explained that her African American heritage already caused people to discriminate against her and that she did not want her sexuality to make her situation worse. For her, Pride did not begin until she was around people who openly embraced their sexuality. Today, King believes that Pride is about finding confidence in oneself. 

Mesteth, on the other hand, described how he grew up with a sense of Pride. As a result, he has not always felt comfortable in Native American peer groups who may or may not accept his sexuality. Likewise, he has not felt welcome in every queer peer group due to his native heritage. For him, an important part of Pride has been finding a peer group with which he could feel comfortable on both accounts. 

Kittleson also asked the group how their concepts of Pride have changed over time. Stansbury shared that “for a long time, Pride, for [him], coincided with shame.” Ng then said that “pride is a journey.” “Pride is a week that I cherish every year,” she shared with those in attendance. “[I] like for us to sit back and look at all the progress we’ve made and enjoy it.” She then told a story about UMM’s 2002 homecoming when the students of the university voted for a king and a queen who were both male because “the queen was totally a queen.” She continued to explain how the students’ decision that year was a huge milestone for the university. 

Kittleson asked the speakers whether or not they attend Pride celebrations. King explained how she has never been to a pride celebration while Stansbury told the attendees that he has only ever gone to one Pride celebration and refuses to attend more due to the fact that he finds them boring. Mesteth explained that he, too, has only ever attended one pride celebration and that it was Black Hills Pride. Unlike Stansbury, however, he explained that he was able to meet older native queers, which he described as being a “life-changing experience.” Professor Ng said that she attends Twin Cities Pride every year, though for many years it was because she was in charge of the UMM booth there. 

Kittleson continued to ask the speakers how they felt about larger corporations supporting Twin Cities Pride. The group responded with mixed feelings. Mesteth shared how it bothers him that some big name corporations will support Pride and yet they will refuse to change any homophobic policies they may have. Stansbury responded by calling big corporations a “necessary evil” because celebrations are expensive and the corporations offer significant funding in exchange for a promotion. 

Maija Kittleson ended the panel by reminding those in attendance that MoQSIE meets every Wednesday evening in the basement of the Multi-Ethnic Resource Center.
