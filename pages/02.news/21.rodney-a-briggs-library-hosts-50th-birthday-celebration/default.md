November 29, 1968 was the grand opening of UMM’s own Briggs Library.    November 29, 2018, half a century later, staff and students gathered on the main floor of Briggs to celebrate and reminisce about 50 years of memories with the library.

The library staff had a few attractions alongside snacks and beverages to present to students and onlookers to help celebrate. Two whiteboards with big text stood in the middle of the main floor with the words “Celebrating 50 Years at UMN Morris Library” and two questions, one of which asked “What are your favorite memories from the last 50 years?” Students and staff alike were given the chance to respond to the prompt with some of their favorite memories on the board. One quote reads “finding treasures in the archives,” a testament to the preservation work the library has done to keep texts, both old and new, available and accessible to everyone. Others are more light-hearted in tone, including “Getting rid of the old curtains,” which made one of the library attendees chuckle as they read it. Others celebrate the various events student organizations hold in Briggs: “giant Jenga hilarity” and “game night” were among the selections. Briggs has evolved beyond just being a place to house books and such; it is truly a place for students to gather.

“One of the best aspects of the library is the staff,” stated Kellie Meehlhause, a library advisor. “We care about each of the students, and we want to help them beyond just finding books. We want to assist them with research and provide them with activities that make Briggs a great place to be!”

The second whiteboard question asks “What would you like to see in the next 50 years at Briggs?” Compared to the first question, this question had received a larger amount of responses.  General concerns regarding the physical status of the library were stated such as “more bathrooms” and “new carpet.” Some of them concern the spaces for students to work, asking for “more space for collaboration” and “more whiteboard space.”

A “big archives display case” was something another student wrote, again demonstrating the legacy of preservation Briggs has with its works. One students asked for “cool technology,” something Briggs has only been improving on over the last several years.

 When asked about the library’s greatest improvement or achievement in the last several years, Kellie responded saying that, was without a doubt, being able to incorporate so many campus services. “We have the tech helpdesk and the research helpdesk,” she told me, “and our research desks and writing labs are only improving. We love helping all of our students.”
 Students definitely love a lot of these features. “I love the writing center,” Megan Quast, a UMM student, said. “I’m bad at writing, so all the professionals there are a huge help! It’s very useful for those of us that need help when it comes to writing.”

In addition to the white boards, there were several smaller archives displaying Brigg’s past, including articles on the library from old publications, one of which was archives of the University Register. Another interesting piece there was a blueprint of Briggs from the 60’s, a rare peek into Brigg’s own construction and the logic behind building it. There was also a slideshow, which showed many events and accomplishments that Briggs had achieved over the years, from installing new computers to fun in-library events.

Students there also shared and reminisced about their favorite moments in the library. “I like the quiet atmosphere, all the books, art, and old brick architecture along with very comfortable furniture makes it a huge pleasure to study in,” Joseph Lauer, a student frequenter of the library told me, praising the library as the perfect study spot. Many students, Joseph included, also wanted to thank the incredibly talented and helpful library staff. “The librarians are also fantastic, shout out to reference librarians that know everything about the library and are always willing to help you get a book, no matter how obscure or hidden!”

The Briggs library continues to aid students while providing a great environment for study, relaxation, and events. Here is to another 50 years of Briggs Library!
