On January 21, the University of Minnesota Morris’ Office of Community Engagement and Office of Equity, Diversity, and Intercultural Programs hosted the Morris Day of Service to celebrate and extend the legacy of the late Martin Luther King Jr.

The Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service is a commemorative holiday that takes place on the third Monday of January and is overseen by the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), a government-run organization that aids in grants for service and volunteer initiatives. After Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday was declared a national holiday back in 1983, 19 years after his assassination, Representatives John Lewis and Harris Wofford presented to Congress “a day on, not a day off” to adhere to King’s vision of building a “beloved community,” where individuals feel empowered, social change is being made, and bridges are built between communities.  

Martin Luther King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929 in Atlanta, Georgia to Martin Luther King Sr, a pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, and Alberta Williams King, an affairs advisor and organ player at Ebenezer. With a doctoral degree in theology and inspired by nonviolent resistance practices of Mohandas Gandhi, King worked toward creating peaceful protests in the American South.  Notable accomplishments of King include creating the first major civil-rights movement protest, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, delivering his speech “I Have A Dream” at the front of the Lincoln Memorial following Bayard Rustin and A. Philip Randolph’s March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and becoming the youngest Nobel Peace Prize recipient in his time.  King was assassinated on April 4, 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee, the day after he gave a speech at the Mason Temple Church in Memphis.

Across Morris, many service projects and volunteer work were available for community members to sign up and participate in.  According to the University of Minnesota Morris’ Office of Community engagement, “In our community, you can choose to help cook and serve a Morris Community Meal, engage in dialogue and make signs for a late afternoon march, and do activities with children related to Dr. King's life and legacy.”  All of the activities took place at Faith Lutheran Church and had something available for any age group.  Starting at 1 p.m., service projects began, which included literacy and art projects with children, community building project, Morris Community Meal preparations.  At this time, posters and signs were also made for the march that took place from 4:30 p.m. to 5 p.m.  The Day of Service ended with a community meal sponsored by Morris Area Women of Today, Morris Kiwanis, McGinnis Appliance, and RiverWood Bank.
