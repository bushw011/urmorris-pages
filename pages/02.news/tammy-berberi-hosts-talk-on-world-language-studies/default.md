To Tammy Berberi, Associate Professor of University of Minne-
sota Morris, there is no such thing as “not a language person.”
Language is not something that someone can pass off as “not their
thing.” On Tuesday, February 13, Berberi led a Founders Scholar
Convocation titled: “Green Worm Under Glass: Studying World
Languages in the 21st Century”. The lecture was a part of a series
where UMM Founders Scholars are given the opportunity to reflect
on, challenge, and advocate for a public liberal arts education. Ber-
beri’s presentation focused on modern trends with studying world
languages in our schools, institutions, and daily lives.
More than 400 languages are spoken in the U.S., yet only 10% of
people in the U.S. speak a language other than English. Enrollment
in language classes (mostly Spanish) has gone up significantly, but
language departments still occupy a small part of the university sys-
tem. Why is this? Berberi reflected that this is a result of the ex-
pansion of cultural programs and the increasing perception that all
global language is the same.

In fact, many students enroll in language courses, but quickly
drop after the requirements are met. 5:1 is the ratio of students en-
rolled in introductory Spanish, French, German, Japanese classes to
the number of students taking advanced language courses. Berberi
cited evidence that undergraduates are abandoning their languagestudies early in order to meet local and national needs.

What results from this decreasing value of foreign languages in a collegiate and
world environment? For one, there is a chronic shortage of qualifications in the job
market. Berberi quoted sources who reported that 40% of business executives failed
to meet their potential, and 30% reported that there were many missed opportuni-
ties. Along with employment and the job market, national security and interna-
tional relations are also affected with the devaluing of language education.

How do we fix this problem? Berberi referenced different forms of L2 (Sec-
ond Language) education motivations. She pointed out that “access correlates with
higher education.” Whether it is someone’s home environment, school, or influen-
tial figures, a person’s access to education is the largest determinant for learning a
second language. Additionally, there are three dispositions that drive these moti-
vations to learn a second language. “Own-ought,” where one must do for oneself;
“other-ought,” where what one is obligated to do for others; and “anti-ought,” the
rebellious impulse that allows for what one wishes to learn and do. These motivate
individuals to learn a second language.

The benefits of L2 learning are plenty. Individuals experience growth in areas
surrounding emotional and spatial intelligence. They gain patience and impulse
control skills. “They have a higher tolerance for ambiguity,” said Berberi. L2 learn-
ing even involves neuroplasticity by building neural pathways.

Berberi debunked a few common myths that exist in the world of language edu-
cation. Most notably, Berberi said that interacting with an app (referencing Duol-
ingo and other language-learning tools) ultimately stunts your growth. “Earning a
gold star” and being rewarded frequently releases the chemical dopamine to excite
your brain. Apps like this can help build your knowledge, but they do not help you
build language or interaction skills.

Near the end of the lecture, Berberi pointed her presentation towards the Morris
campus. She mentioned that course requirements at UMM make it difficult to take
language classes for certain majors. With the small language department, only one
class is able to be offered for each level. She opened the presentation up for discus-
sion, wondering what the audience had to say about language education. Students
wished for an interdisciplinary approach to L2 learning, wanting a broad array of
courses to incorporate the diversity of language. Individuals voiced their concerns
on the scheduling of language courses at UMM. They wished that evening classes
would be held for those students, faculty, or staff that can not fit the normal classes
into their daily schedule. Berberi acknowledged the needs and encouraged action
from UMM leaders.
