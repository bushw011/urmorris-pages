The Iowa caucus has held a key role in the presidential election cycle for decades, giving both voters and candidates a first-look into public support for party candidates and their causes. Not only that, but it has been a predictor on how other candidates will do in other caucuses and primaries. The history and early action of the Iowa caucus have not only brought out initial numbers, but also give winners a potential momentum in the final race in November.

Becoming a huge part of the presidential campaign back in 1972, the Iowa caucus has helped several candidates in the past several decades get a voice on the main electoral stage. Iowa’s caucuses started early in the election year due to the amount of time the state gave for the different levels (precinct, county, district, and state) to count votes back in the 1970s. One of the most notable gains from this early caucus was in 1975 when former president Jimmy Carter ran for presidency. Mostly known by his slogan “Jimmy Who?”, Jimmy Carter gained a significant lead in the presidential candidacy due to his focus on Iowa, leading him to be the underdog of his year. Former president George H.W. Bush had a similar push in 1980, where he focused a lot of his energy and political campaign on Iowa, leading him to be the underdog. Bush called this his “big mow” effect, or big momentum, leading this to be later called the “Iowa Mow.”

A caucus ultimately gives voices of all the everyday people who are eligible to vote a chance to show their initial support with certain candidates. In return, the candidates are up close and personal with the voting public for the first time. Caucuses are set up in a form of a neighborhood political meeting. In Iowa, there are 1,600 locations including schools, libraries, and indoor sports centers that hold the caucuses.

After hearing either the candidate or their representative speak, individuals move to certain areas in the location to show support for a candidate and that number per candidate is tallied. If a group has less than 15% of the total voters, they must disband and form a group that is viable (above 15%) and the tally is retaken. This is done at each location and is then sent to the state for a group tally.

This year, however, was the first year that technological voting took place at the caucuses. Anticipated to make the counting easier, the system ended up putting a major delay on the caucus results. It was not till the evening of February 4 that the numbers of candidates came in. But formally, the results were released by the Iowa Democratic Party (IDP) showing the results of the caucus (as of February 5 at 10 p.m. with 92.6% of total reported precincts): 

• Pete Buttigieg: 26.5%

• Bernie Sanders: 25.6%

• Elizabeth Warren: 19.3%

• Joe Biden: 15.9%

• Amy Klobuchar: 12.1%

The results of the Iowa caucus are not set in stone for the rest of the campaign trail. Although the caucuses have led to several candidates rising higher on the political stage, they do not ultimately mean they will be a party candidate. Also, the demographic of Iowa caucus voters do not reflect the entire demographic of the
United States, making it apparent that the Iowa caucus does not speak for the entire country.
