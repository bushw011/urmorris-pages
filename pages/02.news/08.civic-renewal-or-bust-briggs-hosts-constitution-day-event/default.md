Government is a hot topic in national life right now, and the Morris Campus is no exception! The History Club and Briggs Library hosted a Constitution Day event involving brief lectures on important Constitutional issues and dialogue over people’s questions of Constitutional import. The event featured Roland Guyotte of the History department, as well as Roger Rose and Tim Lindberg, both of the Political Science department. 

Professor Guyotte spoke first, describing the history of voting rights and enfranchisement. He started with the early struggles over who has the vote, which culminated in emancipation across the country and the enfranchisement of black men. The resurgence of white supremacy led to the imposition of poll taxes, literacy tests, and mass intimidation to keep blacks from the polls. 

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed to outlaw the worst bar- riers to voting, but with the _Shelby County v. Holder_ decision, states formerly specified in Section 4(b) are no longer subject to preclearance from the federal government.This has led to the closure of over a thousand polling places, affecting black communities disproportionately. Voter ID laws are also a consequence of the court ruling, which disportionately affects young people, minorities, and the poor. 

Professor Rose’s lecture was on what impeachment technically is, and the grounds for which impeachment can be founded upon. Impeachment is what the House of Representatives does to begin the process of removing officers from federal office. Grounds for impeachment is a criminal act, and different court processes have determined that you cannot impeach officials for policy matters, politics, nor poor governance. If enough evidence of a crime is found, then the House impeaches, while the Senate chooses to convict, as it were. 

Rose then spoke about the possible reasons to impeach Trump, something that political activists have been seeking. Trump is particularly in danger of the emoluments clause of the Constitution, with his vast holdings still making deals and gaining profit overseas. Another area of danger for the President is whether the Special Counsel will find evidence of conspiracy to commit election fraud, with the President already being an unindicted co-conspirator over campaign fraud. Professor Lindberg spoke about the brewing Constitutional crisis over the lack of checking happening between branches of government. The founders were suspicious of factions, which our political parties essentially are. The Federalist Papers warned of what happens when factions capture too much of the government. Still, the Constitution does not account for them, and if the same faction captures multiple branches of government, checks are less likely, and the structure of government does not work.

The Q & A after the lectures started with a question about checks, specifically if control of the legislature flipping counts as a check. Lindberg said it did not, because parties are not a mechanism enshrined in constitutional law. Rose said that it does
count, but it is one we should be wary of relying on.

Oversight is specifically about the functioning of government, and the process can be subverted to instead support specific policy outcomes. Representative Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Russia Committee, used his position to leak documents in support of the Trump administration. Thus, oversight is still at the whim of party politics.

The next question was whether voting rights were still in peril. Guyotte responded in the affirmative, repeating his earlier claims while emphasizing that gerrymandering is the gravest of the threats to voting. Lindberg spoke to the dangers of vote suppression on turnout. If turnout falls more, it calls into question the legitimacy of our elections, which are understood to confer legitimacy only if a sufficient majority participates.

The next question was about the role of the Senate in approving nominees to executive or judicial offices. In practice, there is a distinction drawn for the two types of office, Rose informed the crowd. Congress generally respects the choices that the President makes when appointing their cabinet, and greater still for the lesser offices of the branch, such as deputies, ambassadors, and so on.

The opposition to the Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, last year was historic for the opposition that it drew, Rose said. Other Secretaries in President Trump’s cabinet also drew opposition, although none were denied.

For judicial offices, Rose informed us, the Senate has a history of taking stands and being in opposition to some appointments. Rose and Lindberg drew parallels to the confirmation hearing of Robert Bork, one of President Reagan’s nominees to the Supreme Court in 1987, and the current fight over Judge Kavanaugh.

Bork had been involved with the Nixon administration as the Solicitor General when President Nixon demanded the firing of the Special Prosecutor investigating the Watergate breakin. The then Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General resigned rather than fire the Special Prosecutor, with the firing falling to Bork.

In the current debate, Kavanaugh has a long trail leading through two presidencies: one as Independent Counsel investigating President Clinton for the Whitewater controversy and the Lewinsky affair, the other as the White House Counsel to President Bush. Many documents from these periods of his life remain committee confidential, in Senate parlance, or kept by the President due to executive privilege. In addition, the ongoing scandals of sexual assault are likely to make this con- firmation far more divisive than Bork’s, or even Justice Gorsuch’s last year.

All of these pressing concerns belie the fact the Constitution only means something if we agree collectively that it does. Without great interest from the public in civic life, the Constitution, like this article, is just words on a page.
