The International Trans Day of Remembrance is observed every year on November 20. The Morris Queer Student Initiative for Equality, otherwise known as MoQSIE, held a vigil in Louie’s Lower Level to honor the day and those who did not survive the year. 

Transgender identities are unaccepted in many communities, even in the United States, to this day. Trans people face significantly higher rates of violence and death than does the average person, and while this is well known, few government institutions work on this issue exclusively the way many do for other marginalized peoples. Trans people are stigmatized incessantly, with their identities treated as aberrations and often excluded from housing, healthcare, and work. 

The day was established in 1999 to honor the death of Rita Hester by Gwendolyn Ann Smith. Vigils held across the country often recite the names of those who have been killed since November 20 of the previous year. Lists are published in the month leading up to the Day of Remembrance, but lists can vary based on the verification that each publisher seeks. Some require media reported deaths, others may include only those who died due to transphobic violence. Each vigil has the freedom to expand on any published list and honor the dead however they choose. 

MoQSIE’s vigil this year followed this standard, with the recitation being performed by co-chair Kara Black. While she read the names of the dead, she would pause to allow a candle to be placed by the mourners. The atmosphere was incredibly tense. It was evident that many mourners were seeing themselves in the departed, and contemplating this time next year whose names will be read out. There was a sense that those assembled were one big adopted family, not out of the realm of possibility with how common the story of being disowned is within the trans community. 

Two students offered incredibly personal stories about being trans which sound recurrent in the community. The first student shared about losing an anonymous online friend to violence. The story conveyed that violence  haunts the community, and for those listening to hold tight to those they love. She offered some solace in the form of a proverb: that those who did not get their chance to bloom in this life will bloom in the next. 

Another student offered a story more hopeful than the circumstances would predict. They talked about their father, his bigotry, his close mindedness, and his change as he came to accept them for who they were. He came very close to losing them, and even losing their sibling, but then he suffered a crisis. The crisis brought the two of them back together, and he changed his ways. He has been reliable when many of their family remains obstinate and hostile. 

Listening to the stories being shared, one gets the sense that should they ever find themselves afraid, alone, or otherwise distressed, the queer community in Morris would be there for you. That is something the dead may not have had in life. In bearing witness to their passing, we should all find the resolve to do more before next November brings the same grief.
