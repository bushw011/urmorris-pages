We often take for granted the paper we use every day. Our essays, our problem sheets, even just the nifty artwork we find on the walls all use paper. The events on February 15 and 16, 2019, hosted by the UMM Honors Program, with the help from Joshua Calhoun and Robert Possehl, two artists and educators from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, helped UMM students reconnect with both the paper we write on and the environment from which it came.

**PAPER MAKING**

Friday morning, students gathered in the HFA drawing studio for a demonstration and explanation on how to make homemade paper. Possehl led this activity, demonstrating the steps it takes to create the paper we would use the following day. First, a mold is placed into a tub containing, for students who visited, one
of three sets of materials: wheat grass, which created a more brown paper; cotton rags, which created a purple sheet of paper; or old, recycled pieces of cotton from household items, creating a plain white sheet. The mold is picked up and sifted, like panning for gold, and is then let to dry for a few moments. It is then couched,
or pressed, onto a sheet of Pellon, an interface for fabrics. This allows the paper mold to take shape. Before the paper is finished drying, if someone wanted to engrave a design or put extra material into the paper, it would be double-couched, directly into the paper. Finally, after drying for a brief period, it has 20,000 pounds of pressure applied to it, and is then cooled overnight, bringing us rough, textured paper. Possehl demonstrated his extensive knowledge of paper craftsmanship during this event. 

He told us about utilizing rags to make paper. 

“You tear the rags into one-inch strips, then they’re cut by hand into postage stamp size. They’re washed, and then our Hollander [a motorized trough with a wheel
that smashes the rags] beats the cellulose out of the rags.” 

What was interesting was not just the craftsmanship aspect of creating the paper, but also the extensive biological aspect. 

“Wheat straw is the second most cellulose plant, after cotton,” Possehl told us after most of our sheets had been couched. “Once we bust open the cellulose inside
the cotton or wheat straw and chemically change it, it breaks down, creating a more nuanced ‘fleck’ in the paper.” 

Upon seeing the dried cotton paper, we could observe blue and red speckles on it, creating a beautiful tapestry of color on the paper. The wheat straw had a more rustic, earthy look to it, and resembled much older sheets of paper. 

When asked about coloring cotton, Possehl laughed and replied, “The dyes in the sheets are already set, so I can set whatever colors in it!” 

The students who gathered at the event found it to be relaxing, and rather fun! Hannah Buysse, a third-year education major, was impressed with the availability of
the materials. “I think it’s really cool that it’s made out of cotton you could find anywhere! Normally, I can’t stand the texture of cotton, but this was super nice! Just
pulling it around, it reminded me a lotof paper mache!”

Possehl also had on display his collection of assorted paper he had made. The paper was part of a separate project he had been working on, collecting materials
from around the Midwest and converting them into an “art-paper” of sorts. There were many styles of paper, from paper from farmlands that had residue of old crops woven into it, to paper that looked exactly like it was made of denim, to paper that could have been a painting in and of itself, woven with wheat straw and other plants.

The event concluded early in the afternoon, with the papers hung up to dry on racks and on windows for the following day.

**THE NATURE OF PAPER: AN ENVIRONMENTAL RETELLING OF MEDIA HISTORY**

Later in the afternoon of Friday, February 15, Joshua Calhoun took to the basement of HFA to present his lecture. In it, he began by proposing simply that plants are “defenseless against time’s scythes,” and that plants have become the influencer of paper from the early renaissance period all the way until today. Calhoun stated that “we need to talk about these things we record our stories on.” He asked that we all pull out our phones, and realize that companies like Apple want to exploit the remainder of our finite resources, and therefore most of our technology we use to view media has a finite expiration date attached to it. Conversely, paper has been made for the better part of the last several centuries, and according to Calhoun, “is from all forms of ecological matter.” This creates a ripple effect in the environment. However, paper isn’t just a one-and-done, deal.

“We need to find the right matter to convey these words.” he said.

As time has gone on, human methods of communication have evolved, and thus created a corruption of our non-human matter. That is to say, the media which we
view our stories and news on has changed dramatically, and therefore older resources are slowly being dwindled away. Thus, Calhoun proposes we observe the process he dubs “Makening”: the process over the product. 

Calhoun then went into the history portion of his lecture: he argued that the narratives attached to paper often look from the past to the present, in the evolution of materials and distribution, as well as the proliferation of paper from east to west, and expansion towards limitation. Throughout his lecture he worked backwards from this point, beginning at the end, post-expansion in the west, and walked back towards the conception and corruption of natural paper resources. He invokes specifically American Romantic-era writer Henry David Thoreau, and his quotes about modern technology and how certain technologies need no explicit correction. Calhoun attributes this to paper, how despite the fact that we have arguably superior forms of media portrayal, paper is a timeless, uniform item, and has not changed all that much over the course of history. Calhoun actually got to read a portion of Thoreau’s journal, and understand certain opinions of his about paper, though most of the journal was illegible and needed more time to be deciphered, another one of Calhoun’s projects.

Calhoun then went on to a humorous anecdote about how paper was made from practically everything during times of rag shortages: beets, asbestos, asparagus,
seaweed, even excrement was considered for paper making. The next day, during the creative writing workshop, Calhoun made a joke to me that he hands his
students sticky notes with reminders or recommendations, and then cheekily informs them “Oh, yeah, and that note’s made of elephant dung.” The reactions are priceless. In times of rag shortages, raw materials are also in short supply. This leaves a lot of works from writers potentially lost in history due to the lack of paper
availability. Thus, we must take caution from our environment, as if we lose the art and majesty of paper, certain stories and tales may be lost to the vacuum of
time. Calhoun closed the lecture with a joke about rag shortages: his next book is going to be delayed by a few months, due to a paper shortage at the printing
company. Ironic, but a fitting way to close the lecture.

**CREATIVE WRITING WORKSHOP**

On the morning of Saturday, February 16, Calhoun and Possehl returned to the HFA drawing studio to return the paper we made to us, and any other student
who wanted to participate in the workshop. After flexing our paper like dollar bills to get rid of any bends and creases, the workshop began. Creative writing professor at UMM Athena Kildegaard offered a suggestion for writers who needed a push: the paper we made was made entirely from recycled rags. People thought those rags were unnecessary, and threw them out or donated them. However, they come back to us in ways we can not even comprehend, and in the end we’re grateful to them. That, or we never throw them away, and they hold a place in our hearts. We were encouraged to write with these themes in mind. The mood was somber throughout: some of the students grabbed their paper and left, preferring to work in the comfort of their own place. Others stayed, and drew or doodled on the paper, just to see what it was like to feel the drag of a pen on the homemade paper. Some wrote poetry or short stories on them, truly connecting with the paper on a deeper level.
These events enabled UMM students and staff to not only experience the magic of creating a writing surface, but also to help us reconnect with the paper--and environment--around us, and appreciate it for what is there, and what is unseen.
