David Treuer was always “pissed off” when he saw how Native Americans are depicted in media. Seeing “the same old rez story” of deprivation, devastation, and hopelessness irked him. A scholar and activist, Treur recounted a time when he was particularly frustrated during his presentation on Thursday, March 1 in the Cow Palace. When the Red Lake Reservation shooting occurred, he remembered the media wanting to depict reservation life as “traumatic” and a “ghostlike existence.” His dad was a high school teacher in Red Lake and Treur had numerous other family who lived there. When news outlets reported the shooting they would specifically, in a sorrowful and demeaning tone, show that the area was made up of Native Americans. “When Columbine happened, they didn’t say ‘In an Anglo-west European community…’.” 

Treur sought to write a book that accurately shows the Native American life. For five years, he journaled in a reservation about the locals and the stories they told. After submitting a final draft to his editors, his book was turned down. His editors told him that he would need to start completely over. So, he went back.

When writing his second-attempt at the novel, Treuer integrated his own experiences into the narrative. One of the most influential people in his life was his grandfather, who, to the surprise of his family, committed suicide one day. Treuer described his grandfather as a tough guy; he had a sword on the wall, he was very intimidating, and he was notably stubborn. When fighting with his wife, Treuer’s grandfather would relentlessly argue until everyone was tired. Conflict is something Treuer grew up with regularly, and he learned it often is resolved when people create some distance. “What’s the point of being mad at someone when you have to be mad at them from far away?” Treuer posed. 

Treuer was asked to clean up the mess of the spot where his grandfather committed suicide. Because no one else was going to do it, Treuer cleaned the room when the body had been taken out. He recounted scrubbing the carpet clean of blood and feeling remarkably angry. Angry at the cheap carpet for not being strong enough to hold his grandfather’s blood. Angry at the world, for taking away a person who Treur never understood. 

When giving his grandfather’s eulogy at the funeral, Treuer wanted to write something true. He did not want to characterize his grandfather as a saint because he was not. Treuer had a similar attitude when writing about the reservation in his book. “It’d be easy to see his life in the way the media did - sad and dull.” When looking at the life of his grandfather, Treuer saw that he got to spend 80 out of 83 years in the only place in the world that mattered to him: the reservation. Yet, the rest of the world would not have seen this.

Circumventing this into his narrative, Treuer saw how reservations are shown to society as “less of everything...Less access to education, less happiness…” He challenged the audience to think about reservations having more in certain ways. There is more law (the tribal police). There may be more poverty, but that means there is a surplus of hustle in the community. There is more pain in reservations, but this often brings more connection and humor with one another. There may be more bad schools, but this means there is more of a chance to go back and make a difference. 

“We can expect more of ourselves.” Parents often share their story of survival, said Treuer. They don’t share many triumphs or stories of success; they may just live life trying to survive. “We can do more than that,” Treuer told the crowd that instead of living to survive, we can live to excel. 

Closing the lecture, he read a selection from his book aloud. It was a memory of sitting in the crowd at his grandfather’s funeral, looking at the individuals around him. To his right, was a murderer. To his left was a man that sacrificed 30 years of his life in prison, only to get revenge. The fancy treatment of Native Americans isn’t Treuer’s way of accurately depicting a culture. He sought to show truth in the way they communicate, act, and live their lives.
