On the last day of October, the Office of Community Engagement hosted the annual Trick or Can event from 5 to 8:30 p.m. Every year, University of Minnesota Morris students trick or treat so that others can eat, taking to the streets of Morris and collecting donations for the Stevens County Food Shelf. The Stevens County Food Shelf accepts nonperishable items, unopened personal care items, and monetary donations by cash or check. According to this year’s organizers, more than 90 students participated, with some staff members assisting at the food shelf. The final numbers have not been totaled, but everyone involved with setting up this year’s Trick or Can were more than pleased with the evening’s participant turnout.

The Office of Community Engagement hopes that students continue to attend these events, in order to “gain a greater sense of awareness of the needs of our community and how they can identify with their community. All of our events aim to develop a better sense of identity for individuals and groups. With all of the divisions we see in our world, it’s incredible to see student organizations come together with other student organizations and serve a common cause. Helping starts a ripple effect. With every event we have, we try to get those ripples moving.”

Trick or Can was made possible by community sponsors Subway, Sodexo, and Pizza Ranch.
