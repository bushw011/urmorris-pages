“It’s community that keeps us here” said Ben Winchester, research fellow with the University of Minnesota Extension Center for Community Vitality. “Small towns are not dying. They are, in fact, thriving!” Last Wednesday, February 21, UMM hosted a campus discussion on leadership in small towns featuring key speakers such as Winchester. Titled, “The Future of Community Engagement and Leadership in Rural America,” the discussion was oriented around expert opinion on what successful community leaders are accomplishing and how they are accomplishing it.

Winchester, graduated at UMM and now a rural sociologist, began the discussion asking the question, “How many people do we need to run our towns?” How many people do we need to lead the organizations that make up our communities? Essentially, organizations operate on a supply and demand basis. A group like Kiwanis meets its supply with people contributing the the framework of the organization, working together to help ensure it operates. They do this for the demand of the community. “Community leadership isn’t just nice...it’s necessary.” Winchester focused on the two different types of community organizations: governmental and non-profits. He cited evidence of how Minnesota has been rapidly gaining nonprofit involvement. Social vibrancy is increasing and the small town organizations that exist in a community directly reflect the citizens of the town.

Yet, there seems to be problems in the composition of these groups. When new, young members join, they are often met with criticism or dislike. Winchester referenced TIMES articles across the generations where the covers all had one thing in common: shaming the self-obsessed new generations. “We have to be careful about how we talk about people,” he said. How we treat new leaders of our community organizations has a massive impact on their success.

With younger leaders, Winchester noted that organizations have had shifting types of involvement. Historically, groups have been more location-based and have had broad focused interests, like the Rotary Club. Now, organizations cover a wider geographical area and have more narrowly-focused interests such as an association that gathers with a communal interest in snowmobiles.

When it comes to leading community organizations, Winchester says to limit the number of groups you ever get involved in to three. “We aren’t here to rubber stamp our communities. We are here to work between meetings and get stuff done.” An individual that commits themselves too much to too many activities is doing harm to the groups they are involved in because they are not as focused.

The next speaker on the panel was Catie Rasmusson, another representative from the U of M Extension Center for Community Vitality. Her discussion focused on building social capital in communities. Initially, she commented on how there is a common view that we, as a society, are losing social capital. She defined social capital as “the networks and cooperative relationships among members of a community that allow them to act collectively and solve problems together.”

Rasmusson said that social capital is actually a part of a Community Capitals Framework that encompasses several forms of capital: human, social, built, political, natural, financial, and cultural. These all form positive and negative outcomes that influence a community’s success. Social capital also involves three different types of group connections: bonding, where the organization bonds together; bridging, where different people from different organizations connect; and linking, where people from community organizations connect with individuals who have resources and, often, political power.

Rasmusson has started several County Bridging Programs wherein a cohort of individuals in a community are brought together to work on leadership development. They tour the community’s resources and assets and discuss the future of community engagement. What has she found? These groups are not made up of elderly, aged members. They are actually young, mainly millennials, committed to fostering leadership and profit development in their town. Rasmusson documented that these programs build social capital, and thus give community members satisfaction and success.

The third speaker was Becky Adams, a recruitment coordinator for the Blandin Community Leadership Program. She emphasized the importance of diversity in programs dedicated to community leadership. Adams talked on how different people bring different passions to discussion. “Everybody’s role is important and should be valued.”Adams finished her talk with questions from the crowd, where concerns about attendance at community leadership development programs arose. Individuals from UMM commented that it is often difficult to get people committed to new events or organizations on campus. Winchester offered a solution: “Don’t throw your doors open. Invest in people so they want
to come.” He emphasized making connections with people so that they feel motivated to come to your new event or club. It does not do anything to just “open your doors” and wait for people.

From the discussion, it was evident that communities are in dire need of new leaders. In rural counties in MN, ND, and SD, approximately 1 in 5 people in a town are expected to rise to a leadership position. This demand is rising, and many rural communities are unable to keep up. Winchester, Rasmusson, and Adams, pointed to the youth for the future of leadership training. They showed that small towns are ready for change. It’s up to the future generations to fulfill the potential rural communities possess.
