On Tuesday, November 19, at 6 p.m. University of Minnesota Morris (UMM) education faculty member Sara Lam and UMM student Jordan Leung presented on the Hong Kong protests, formally known as the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill (or Anti-ELAB) movement, that have been happening since June. Taking place in the Turtle Mountain Cafe, the presentation had over 50 attendees from both the campus and town community.

To start the presentation, Lam discussed the history of Hong Kong and its relationship with China. Hong Kong was an established British colony from 1842 to1997. During that time, there were several reforms and developments that took place within China and Hong Kong that formed them into separate societies. Lam specifically focused on the huge changes that took place in mainland China, such as culture, politics, and language policies. But she also noted specific events of famine, civil war, cultural revolution, focusing especially on the Tiananmen massacre.

The Tiananmen massacre of 1989 took place in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, and became the first incident where military tanks and assault rifles used by the Chinese police opened fire on protesters. It was around this time that many Hong Kong individuals less identified with being Chinese and more with being individuals from Hong Kong.

More current issues that Lam brought up included the Pan-Democracy movement of 2013, which focused on political and cultural issues that were going on between China and Hong Kong. Politically, China pushed to punish individuals who committed treason against the mainland or went against tradition; laws were passed revolving around this issue but the terms were so broad that any part that opposed communist China could be punished. Cultural discrepancies go along with China trying to replace Cantonese with Mandarin in the Hong Kong islands and, as Lam states it, “fosters the loyalty of children to the communist party and the Republic of China” within the education systems. There is an annual protest revolving around these issues and other universal suffrage issues in Hong Kong. The protest takes place every July 1 and is organized by the Civil Human Rights Front.

The current protests taking place in Hong Kong started on June 9 after the discussion of an extradition bill began. A Hong Kong man murdered his pregnant girlfriend while in Taiwan and returned to Hong Kong, but he was not able to be tried in Hong Kong because it took place in Taiwan. This is because of the lack of an extradition bill with Taiwan where they could extradite the trial to Hong Kong. Hong Kong has extradition bills with other countries but not with Taiwan. This discussion of curating other extradition bills with other countries brought up the discussion with creating one with China. New York Times author, Mike Ives, states that: “The bill would allow Hong Kong to detain and transfer people wanted in countries and territories with which it has no formal extradition agreements, including Taiwan and the Chinese mainland. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, has said “the new law is urgently needed to prosecute a Hong Kong man who is wanted in Taiwan for the murder of his girlfriend.”

However, this decision was not taken well with the general Hong Kong public. Lam states that this bill puts the decision making in the hands of the chief executive officer of Hong Kong, a public official appointed by mainland China. Ives justifies this, stating that Hong Kong’s citizens “fear they could end up in a mainland legal system where the Communist Party routinely prosecutes dissidents and others for political reasons.”

So on June 9, protest began when the Hong Kong government refused to withdraw the bill. It was on June 12 that the bill was supposed to go to Hong Kong’s legislative council to be passed. Protests blocked the main streets that led to the legislative council, preventing big politicians from reaching the council. It was on this day that tear gas and rubber bullets were used on the crowd.

Leung then chimed in for the second part of the presentation where he discussed the protests. Leung took part in the protests while he was home in Hong Kong for the summer and described where and what he was doing during the protest. He began by stating five demand that the protesters had: to withdraw the bill, to investigate police brutality, to retract the “riot” label, amnesty, and arrests of protesters, and universal suffrage. 

He went on to explain several of key events and protests that took place over the course of the summer. The protest’s first casualty took place on June 15 when a man who was sitting on the rooftop of a building jumped off after posting a sign thatcalled for stopping the bill and stopping police brutality. It was the day after this casualty that the protest totalled a following of 2 million individuals, nearly one-fourth of Hong Kong’s population. Leung continued by discussing multiple strikes and protests that took place from June to August, specifically the event on August 12, where protesters occupied the Hong Kong International Airport, causing many flights to be cancelled or delayed. This was a major breakthrough because the airport is one of the biggest sources of international income. But Leung also stated that there were several protests that took place peacefully. Many protests included post-it’s posted across the country, human chains, gatherings of song and prayer, etc.

Lam and Leung came together to discuss the important themes they have talked about over the course of discussing the protests. The two major themes come from peaceful protesters and frontliners being held by a strong bond of change, commonly stating that “even a nuclear bomb cannot tear us apart,” and the use of police brutality as a political tool.

To conclude, Lam and Leung discussed the costs of the conflict. That there were several unnecessary deaths and injuries that took place, even to bystanders; that trust in public institutions drastically diminished over the course of these protests; and that family relationships were tested, stained, and/or damaged by the conflicts.

After twenty weeks of constant protesting, the Hong Kong government formally withdrew the bill on October 23.
