Super Tuesday was held on Tuesday, March 3, and got fourteen states’ voters out to the polls to vote in the primaries. Its importance lies in the numbers, where it is the single-most biggest day for the Democratic nominee candidates to win delegates. A day that started out as a way for the Democratic party to endorse a more moderate candidate has become one of the most heavily influential days in the primary elections.

**THE INFLUENCE OF SUPER TUESDAY**

Although it can appear that states voting on Super Tuesday want a general influence for their region, it is more or less that each state wants to have a say earlier in the nomination contest in order to prevent themselves from being the decision-makers if the race comes super close. 

This Super Tuesday, 34% of the national delegates are up for grabs, 30% from California alone. First candidate to reach a majority of nearly 4,000 delegates wins the nomination and will go up against President Donald Trump this November. Fourteen states and participated: Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansa, Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, Utah, California, and Minnesota. 

It is not by popular vote that an individual is given the Democratic party’s nomination, but the delegate total, which is based off a formula that gives each state a certain number of delegates based off of population and weight (if the state is Democratic-leaning or not).

**HOURS BEFORE SUPER TUESDAY: EXPECTATIONS**

Coming into Super Tuesday, it appears to be a race between the top two candidates: former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Democratic Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren is still within the race, but not many are voting in her direction. Warren has been projected to win at least her home state of Massachusetts.

According to the Washington Post, there is still a lack of clarity who is leading the Democratic nomination between Biden and Sanders. With former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar and investor Tom Steyer dropping out of the race and endorsing Biden after his victory in South Carolina, it has been seen that their endorsements made impacts on their individual leading states in Biden’s favor.
