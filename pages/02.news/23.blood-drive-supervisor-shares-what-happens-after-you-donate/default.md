On February 6 and 7, 2019, the American Red Cross’s Blood Drive came to UMM. Dozens of students, faculty, and staff came to the student center’s alumni room, 12:30 to 6:30, to have their blood drawn for donation. Bradley Doege, the supervisor of the drive, was very happy to have such a large turnout.

"We love having students come to the drive to donate their blood,” Doege told us. “The students who come in are very happy to be here, they love it. They’re in good spirits, and if they have to wait, that’s fine with them because they get to miss class!” The students who had their blood drawn also felt a sense of pride for donating their blood. “After all,” Doege said, “one donation of blood equals three saved lives!”

All of the blood collected during the drive is first sent to the Twin Cities to be lab-tested. Afterwards, it is then distributed to hospitals in need of blood, first in Minnesota and then across the rest of the United States. However, more is always needed. Doege offered a helpful anecdote for people worried about having their blood drawn: “It’s like an oil change for your body. We take out some of the old blood to help people out, and your body pumps in all the new blood, clean and ready to work. No different from a normal checkup or when you get sick, it’s just your body repairing itself.”

The blood drive is also very grateful to receive blood recently, due to the cancellations of many of their blood drives across Minnesota and the broader Midwest due to the Polar Vortex that occured the previous week. “We’ve especially been in need because of the vortex,” Doege said. “A lot of people are in need during that time, and since we can’t get blood, it’s been difficult to help people.” Many people were reported frozen to death or injured during the Polar Vortex due to extreme temperatures.

When asked about what students should do to prepare to donate their blood, or if they were hesitant, Doege told us: “Make sure you eat lots of food and drink lots of water; you don’t want to get dizzy or pass out while your blood’s being drawn. The needle doesn’t hurt, either. And just think: one donation of your blood will save three people, and that feels really good.”
