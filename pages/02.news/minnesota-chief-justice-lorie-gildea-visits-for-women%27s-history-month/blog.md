On March 16, 2021, the Chief Justice of Minnesota Lorie Gildea visited Morris virtually as the keynote speaker for EDI’s Women’s History Month programming, which highlighted women in government this year.

Chief Justice Gildea is a Morris alumni who attended the university, earned a B.A. in Political Science, and was later awarded the Distinguished Alumni Award. Gildea went on to attend Georgetown University where she earned a Juris Doctorate and graduated magna cum laude.

Gildea recounted her time as a small-town girl from Northwest Minnesota, earning her education during a time where attitudes towards women in the legal profession and the workplace at large before then.

In 1970, only a decade before she began her education at UMN Morris, a women’s rights group at NYU asked women to report the comments they received when applying to law firms - several of the law firms responded to the women with numerous discriminatory, sexist statements ranging from “We don’t like hiring women,” to asking whether the women were planning on having children.

Gildea said there were plenty of reasons for loved ones to intervene and convince her to choose a different path; but she was fortunate to receive nothing but steadfast support from family, friends and mentors who told her, “Of course you can” when she decided to apply to Georgetown University. She continued to elaborate by paying homage to some of those family, friends, and mentors, as well as the women in the law profession who paved the way for her. This included Martha Engle-Dorset, Minnesota’s first female attorney; Betty Whitlock-Washburn, the first female judge in Minnesota; Rosalie Wahl, the first woman appointed to the Minnesota Supreme Court; Kathleen Blatz, Minnesota’s first woman Supreme Court Chief Justice; Lena O Smith, the first African American Lawyer and President of the Minneapolis NAACP; and Wilhemina Wright, the first African American woman to serve on the Minnesota Supreme Court.

Gildea also paid her respects to Bettina Blake, UMN Morris’s former Dean of Academic Affairs. Chief Justice Gildea praised the former Dean for the outsized role she played in her life; remarking that she lived and breathed the mission of the university and was focused on making the campus a better place to live, learn, and work. She also said that Blake used her position to develop the next generation of leaders who would come after her, and that she would not have the confidence to pursue a career in law without Bettina Blake.

Women like Bettina Blake are who Chief Justice Gildea said define the true story of women’s history - a hard fight by generations of women pioneers smashing glass ceilings - reaching the top of their ladders to help other women reach higher on their own.
