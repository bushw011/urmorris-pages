Climate change is looking bleaker in the real world with the release of the latest IPCC report, but it has always been bleak on the silver screen.

On October 16, the Political Science discipline hosted Professor Sean Parson as part of the Jooinn Lee lecture series. His talk utilized fiction, climate research, and philosophy to paint a picture of our looming climate cataclysm, and whether we are prepared to respond to it. 

A few weeks ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its report on the possibility of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celcius, and the magnitude of difference between 1.5 degrees Celcius and 2 degrees Celcius. The predictions are dire, with previously studied thresholds being reached at 1.5 degrees Celcius instead of 2 degrees Celcius. Water scarcity, impacts of extreme heat events, and flooding will be widespread with 1.5 degrees Celcius. The existing terms under the Paris Agreement, even if the U.S. were to remain a party to them, would not be sufficient for avoiding 2 degrees Celcius in warming. The report offers some hope, in that many of the technologies are already invented that the world will need to limit warming. However, the political will to see it through is unlikely to materialize. 

So how are we coping with all of this information? Climate change haunts our popular imagination, directly or indirectly in stories like _The Day After Tomorrow_ and this past spring’s _Avengers: Infinity War_. The reason Parson studies these texts, as opposed to historical documents and the like, is the unique insight into the concerns, anxieties, and desires of their times they hold. The fifties included many movies about the threat of Soviet Russia, such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers, while the eighties included movies about America being left behind, such as Blade Runner. Parson’s presentation here focused on two recent films to illustrate their conceptions of the apocalypse, Mad Max: Fury Road and Snowpiercer. 

Before he could dissect the films, Parson needed to illustrate the order that both are reacting against, that of liberal democracy. Property rights, individualism, and sovereignty are fundamental aspects of liberalism. Liberalism forms hierarchies, but these hierarchies are often accepted because of belief in personal merit, that those who reach the top earned their position. These conceptions of the way of the world are inflexible when confronting a challenge to their existence. If liberalism does not destroy alternate conceptions, it adopts crueler and more rigid structures to uphold itself.  In the liberal imagination, there are often only two outcomes when confronted with climate change: fascism or a managerial society. 

_Snowpiercer_ explores what happens should humanity take the path of a managerial society. In an attempt to thwart climate change, humanity accidently caused a new ice age. Only  the people who were on a train powered by a perpetual motion engine survived. In time, the cars of the train calcified into a class system, immutable and controlling. The front of the train holds the privileged, the middle those who support that privilege, and the back of the train holds the dispossessed, forced to do the hardest labor to keep the train going. At the end of the film, the dispossessed chose to destroy, rather than inherit, the system they were in. They chose exodus for some, in the hopes of a better future. 
_
In Mad Max_, the world is carved into tribes, each with harsh structures upholding the current regime. This fascist world is particularly cruel to women, the powerless, and the tribeless. Max is captured to be used as a “blood bag” by the forces of Immortan Joe, a despot whose people regard him as a god. Over the course of the film, Max partners with Furiosa, but not without significant distrust on both of their parts. They ultimately come to be not simply allies, but comrades, people who must overthrow a common enemy and share a common fate. They attempt an exodus as in Snowpiercer, but this exodus fails, leading them to fight Immortan Joe and forcibly reclaiming power and resources. 

The original meaning of the word ‘apocalyptic’ meant a revealing. The IPCC report is apocalyptic, in this sense and potentially in its conventional sense as well. The reveal is the limits and the potential end of global capitalism. In our world, there is no hope for avoiding catastrophe; it is bearing down on us as we debate which one we prefer. The IPCC report and these films tell us we need a new politics to address climate change, the politics of doom. 

There are five tenets to the politics of doom, according to Parson: 
- Salvage socialism
- Salvage democracy
- Salvage technology
- Salvage philosophy
- Salvage solidarity

The net effect is to create a system that can respond to climate change without falling into despotism, a response that only guarantees a future for the few. Whether this call is heeded is up to us all, and what prevails will indeed determine the future of humanity.
