The 45th annual Midwest Philosophy Colloquium is introducing students to the world of epistemology with its theme of conspiracy theories. UMM is hosting six different experts in the field over Zoom to discuss and present their research.

This year, the colloquium is taking a different format. The event is being drawn out over the entire year for ten different talks and presentations. The colloquium will be divided into two parts: the classic debate and the state of the art.

The first part (happening currently) is in the form of conversations between philosophy students and philosophers. These events will be held on some Tuesdays until Nov. 24. The next section will be presentations with dates to be announced.

Three talks have been held so far featuring Michael Levine, Steve Clarke, and the starter of the debate — Brian Keeley. Keeley is best known for his article “Of Conspiracy Theories,” which defines “unwarranted conspiracy theories” and describes what makes a conspiracy theory irrational. In the future, the talks and presentations will be focused on the debate between Keeley’s views and other people’s ideas. 

Now, the topic is especially relevant, given the immediateness of the internet when it comes to publishing ideas — both well researched and not.

“It seemed like a timely idea since conspiracy theories are in the news and influencing politics these days,” said colloquium organizer Mark Collier. But relevancy is not the only topic. Collier expressed that it is important to share the practicality of philosophy with students — to let them know that it “is not just a pie-in-the-sky activity, but that it can address contemporary concerns.”
