On Thursday, February 13, the University of Minnesota Morris’ Culture Hour featured Adelou Atolani, who spoke of his motherland of Nigeria. He talked about many different aspects of Nigerian life, including the meanings of names, languages, weddings, music, clothing, and food. He began by saying that names in Nigeria have
Christian meanings. For example, his name, Adeolu Atolani, means “crown of God” and “born into wealth.” Ade is from the Hausa, which is the largest ethnic group and language spoken in Nigeria. Ade wore beads to the presentation, and said that these specific beads he wore signified royalty. Ade’s grandfather was an African prince, but since Ade and his family live in America, they are cut off from the royal bloodline.

In Nigerian culture, respect is shown in how people greet each other. Younger people bow to older people that they meet, say “E farro,” meaning good morning, and call them by ma, sir, mommy, or daddy. Women must bow with both knees to men and must be told to get up before they stand. Men bow to their elders with a half push-up formation, or with one hand on the ground. There are two weddings in Nigerian culture. There is first a traditional wedding, which is colorful, full of song and
dance, and attendees spread money on the groom and bride as a prayer of wealth. Then, there is an American wedding in a classic western style. 

The music in Nigeria is upbeat and has themes of religion, life and love. Some examples of clothing in Nigeria include the gele, a woman’s colorful headwear; the Iro, a woman’s wrap skirt; the Buba, a blouse; and the Buba and the Sokoto, a long shirt and pants that Ade wore. As for food, Ade described some of his favorite dishes, including Suya (a spice on chicken, rice, and soup), Punded yam, and okra soup.
