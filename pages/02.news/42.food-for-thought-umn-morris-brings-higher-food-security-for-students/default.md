Over the course of the past year, several food totes have been popping up all over campus, from the 24-hour study lounge to the Multi-Ethnic Resource Center. But this project has been only a piece of a bigger problem that many campuses, including the University of Minnesota Morris, face when it comes to the student body: food security.

According to Oregon State University’s Human Services Resource Center Coordinator Clare Cady’s article “Food Insecurity as a Student Issue,” “Food insecurity is a threat to student success on college campuses in the United States. It has the potential to impact academics, wellness, and behavior-all factors that have bearing on student retention and graduation rates.”

The MyU announcement post stated: “The University of Minnesota Morris knows that college can put a financial stress on students. To help out, UMN-Morris has available resources to those students who need help finding their next meal.” The Morris Campus Student Association (MCSA) posted on their official Twitter showing
thanks to MCSA First Year Council and the campus’ communication staff for helping share the resource to MyU.

The locations of the food security project include: 

• Food Totes: Office of Academic Success (Briggs), One Stop (Behmler), NASS Programs (Blakely), Student Counseling (Behmler), Summit Scholars (Blakely), UMM Police Department (Behmler) 

• Food Shelf Transportation as needed 

• SNAP, government assistance (online, Stevens County Human Services)

• Student Assistance Grants for Emergencies (One Stop)

• Native American Garden and the Organic Gardening Club (Not able to assist in the winter)

• Morris Healthy Eating, Wellness Center
