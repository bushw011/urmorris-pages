Every year, memorials to the tragedy of September 11 do their best to capture hearts and minds. This year, the memorial is capturing them with cranes and flags, and not just the American one.

The display on the mall this year is thanks to the Muslim Student Association; the Black Student Union; the Campus Activities Council; the Circle of Nations Indigenous Association; the College Republicans; the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Intercultural Exchange; the Minnesota Public Interest Research Group; the Morris Campus Student Association; and the Morris Queer Student Initiative for Equality. 

The collaboration is “a tribute to the fearless and courageous young lives lost in the tragic incident that shook the entire world on September 11,” said MSA Co-Chairs Esmira Alieva and Ahnaf Prio in a written response. 

On Monday, the organizers managed a huge turnout of members of the aforementioned groups, and many average students to fold paper cranes and plant flags on the mall. The many national flags on display represent countries who lost people to the attacks. 

“The cranes are a symbol of peace,” said co-chair Prio. “We wanted to come up with something that will engage the students. Something small. Something that would catch the eye. Something unique! We got inspired from ‘Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes.’”

Both symbols represent unity for our people, our country, and our world. You could see it in the many different faces of the attendees, the languages being spoken, and the stories being shared. 

According to the co-chairs, the memorial is less the physical display than it is the process of bringing people together with a single goal. In one voice, the many people of disparate backgrounds are saying “We Remember” to the victims of September 11. 

Special inspiration for the memorial came from the College Republicans, who annually display 2,996 flags in remembrance of the American victims of the attacks. Prio credits the College Republicans for reaching out and “making us stronger” with their collaboration. Prio challenges anyone to look at the memorial and not see unity between the various flags and the people who put them up. 

In the memorial, there was personal significance for the members of MSA and the co-chairs themselves. Prio recalled the attacks clearly, as his father had friends working in Manhattan. He remembers the terror on his father’s face as friends did not answer their phones, and the television relayed the images of the burning World Trade Center. 

“I remember looking at my [TV] screen of the terrifying videos of the collapse,” said Prio. “I was scared, very scared. It was an incident that had a global impact. A little Bangladeshi kid who lived on the other side of the world even felt it.” 

For Alieva, her first experience of September 11 was in the U.S., which was horrible, as she is Muslim. 

“I felt there were people who would not let me join in to feel what they felt,” said Alieva, “simply because I was Muslim, and [maybe I] should be part of the people to blame for it as well. This is actually what inspired me to work on the memorial this year[.]”

By organizing the event, the co-chairs hope that they can focus on unity instead of division in the face of tragedy.

On that goal, Prio is hoping “that we still honor and remember the lives lost. I am also hoping that people remember this day in their future as the day they forgot who they were individually and worked together as one. I believe an event where clubs such as BSU, CAC, CR, MPIRG, MCSA, MSA and others worked together was considered impossible on our campus because of the false impression that some people simply just do not get along. [Using] this event [to showcase] our unity, I personally, would view as our biggest achievement. We could have not done it without all of our friends and mentors and advisers.”
