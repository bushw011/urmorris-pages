For Valentine’s Day, a small group of students from the Office of Residential Life held a program, Flirting Around The World, about the dos and don’ts of flirting in different countries. Both entertaining and informative, this program educated students about cultural differences. For example, while a bit of eye contact is considered to be respectful and can even be considered flirtatious here in the US, it is seen as disrespectful elsewhere. This goes for other behaviors such as physical contact, how one would address others that they are flirting with, and many other aspects of communication, both verbal and nonverbal.

This program was mostly composed of a slideshow made by a group of ORL staff, then presented by students Justice Robinson, Michael Small, and Chloe Buell. Each slide of the presentation represented a different country and listed behaviors that are respectful or disrespectful in said culture. After discussing what is respectful flirting in each culture, the presenters offered several pickup lines in the language spoken in that country, then showed them translated into English. In addition to these slides, a few quick videos were shown. These humorous videos covered topics such as understanding what constitutes flirting and how to recognize these behaviors in everyday life. Robinson considered these videos the highlight of creating the presentation and explained that a lot of trial and error occured while the group tried to find the perfect clips.

Robinson also shared that some of the most entertaining content they came across in this search was a Korean television show about flirting. Another highlight of this event, as a whole, is that both the presenters and the audience had students coming from different backgrounds, each with different things to bring to the presentation. In fact, the audience got to join in at the end of the program, covering the whiteboard in the room with a collection of pickup lines that ranged from cheesy and obnoxious to genuinely flattering. Everyone found this conclusion to be amusing, and had a lot of fun finding pickup lines to share. Cultural programs, such as this presentation, are held each semester by students who are part of the ORL staff. The quantity of these cultural programs changes with the years depending on not only the diversity and quantity of staff members, but also what students around campus want in events. Because the Office of Residential life is responsible for planning so many campus events, such as Zombie Prom, many ideas for programs are brainstormed early on and used later as desired. Student preferences are a priority in choosing which events are held.

As far as future events that could be considered, Justice Robinson hopes there will be chances for thingssuch as cosplay costume contests, movie marathons, and opportunities to show off more student artists in fun ways.
