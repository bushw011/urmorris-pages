Students and faculty members meet over Zoom for the University’s federally-mandated Constitution Day event on Sept. 15. This year’s discussion theme was “Why our Shared Values are Important,” and the discussion was led by history professor Roland Guyotte along with political science professors Tim Lindberg and Roger Rose.

America is currently experiencing a crisis unlike anything it has seen in modern history. The United States has nearly seven million cases of COVID-19 and over two hundred thousand Americans have died from the virus. Americans are divided over what the proper response to the pandemic should be. And yet, despite the magnitude of the coronavirus pandemic, this just one of many events that have made our political system more polarized in recent history. Due to the state of our present political climate, a discussion of shared values and their importance seemed particularly relevant.

Briggs Library Director LeAnn Dean began the evening by providing an account from the original constitution day. After eighty-one days in-session, approximately four hundred hours of debate, and five hundred and sixty-six votes, the Constitutional Convention produced a four-thousand word document that provided the foundation for all American law that came after it. Roland Guyotte presented an abridged version of the history of the Constitution and the United States from the arrival of the Puritans in North American to the present day, focusing on past periods of political conflict before returning to the present.

Panelists Tim Lindberg and Roger Rose centered their presentations on the importance of shared values in our democracy. Democratic decision making in the United States depends on a shared understanding of basic facts and the willingness of parties to cooperate with one another—two things that are currently in short supply. The panelists went on to examine some bizarre events that had happened in the weeks before the discussion. One such event was President Trump speculating that he might not accept the results from the presidential election if the results are not in his favor, while one of his appointees within Housing and Human services accused epidemiologists of sedition and called for an armed insurrection if Trump does not win the presidency. Recent polls reported that nearly half of the country would be open to a form of government other than a representative democracy and believe this year’s elections will produce unfair results. This concern was repeated by several students in the discussion.

Afterwards, I spoke with Professor Lindberg about what one important message from the event was and what he wants people to consider. “I think the most important thing is the recognition that the Constitution creates a framework for us to understand each other, but that we still need to actually come together and have some sort of shared understanding of how things work. And then within that we operate, and we discuss, and we have conflict, and tension, and that's fine. We wouldn't want everybody to be the same and have the same ideas, but that if we don't even have that if we don't have some sort of shared underpinning that that's when we risk at the worst a civil war, but at the very least, very high civil tensions and conflict.”

Although this year’s event was patently less optimistic than previous years, there was a positive element. One point that was brought up in discussion was that the United States could generally be considered more ‘democratic’ now then at any point in its history. Although attendees were wary, many were cautiously optimistic about the future.
