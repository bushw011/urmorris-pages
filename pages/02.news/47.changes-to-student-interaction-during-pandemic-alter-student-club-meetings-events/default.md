With the implementation of precautionary measures designed to slow the spread of COVID-19, student organizations have experienced difficulty operating under these new conditions. Student organization leaders were especially concerned about recruiting new members.

"I would say that the biggest thing that affected us was like getting out, [and] reaching out to the community, kind of trying to get people involved while being safe, because it's kind of hard to do the [things] we want to do like the outreach and meeting people and trying to convince them to join Mock Trial with COVID because of social distancing, there's not a whole lot of activities on campus right now,” said Mock Trial captain Ryan Rysdahl.

Saddle Club president Katie Beuning has had similar challenges, especially with the Student Activities Fair being hosted online this year.

“We've gotten a couple of new people, but it's definitely not what we'd want, and most of the new people that we get are people that came here knowing there were horses on campus and want to board their horses next semester, and so it's not the groups of people that [don’t] own a horse that we're usually getting in. Usually we get about half and half people that own horses and people that know nothing about horses and we're really not getting that this year. So that's kind of sad cause it's hard to introduce people to horses when they don't even know we have horses on campus and I'm just like, ‘they're there. I promise.’”

Both organizations have had to adapt how they operate on campus. 

“Our big event that we do every year is we do Haunted Barn,” said Beuning. “It's basically just a haunted house in the barn. That's usually our big one and we usually collaborate with a couple other clubs like gladiators and MMA. We obviously can't do that this year because it's hard to do a haunted house and make sure everyone's six feet away. It's hard to scare people from a very long distance. We're not able to do that, which is really upsetting because that's our big fundraiser during the year that we do, and we can't do it anymore. So that's kind of sad.” 

Mock Trial is also adjusting to a reduction in in-person meetings. They are unable to hold in-person competitions, but online meets are being scheduled.

“The organization that organizes Mock Trial, the American Mock Trial Association, is helping us get through it because they are giving information [regarding] online trials and how we could do online tournaments. I think that because there’s a flexibility that exists during COVID, I think we can still do practices and competitions,” said Rysdahl.

Despite being unable to hold meetings in-person, Mock Trial is still trying to hold in-person events.

“The big thing we're going to do now is a movie night on the mall. [We’re working on showing] Legally Blonde. [After that] we can talk to them about Mock Trial and see if they want to join.”

Saddle Club is also scheduling alternative programming. 

“We're going to see if we can set up the stalls have community members come through and take pictures of them that would be Halloween themed,” said Beuning. “That would get people into the space and we could have some sort of an event with a freewill donation, whatever they want. It's definitely not the same; we know we're not going to get the same turnout that we would get if it was Haunted Barn.”

The changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic are affecting administration as well as students. When asked what he thought of the current situation, Assistant Director of Student Activities and Leadership Simón Franco responded, “I think first off is that this is weird, right? It's a weird time we are living in, I don't think any of us were prepared to face up a pandemic at the level that we're facing it now.” 

Franco also addressed the issue of club interaction being reduced by online meetings.

“We're trying to find spaces within the constraints of the pandemic for students to still continue to engage with one another and to continue to fight this level of isolation,” he said. “Our new normal is very different and it's not what we're used to. I think the message that I want to get out there is that it is important for students to find innovative ways to connect with one another.”

Many clubs are already discovering new and innovative ways to connect with students.

“There are some really cool things that are coming out,” said Franco. “Some organizations are thinking outside the box. The Morris Gladiators, for example, decided to use the mall to host a Wizard’s Chess type game. They developed all these rules where they would play chess on the mall with the squares that are drawn there and whenever you took a space then combat would ensue. It has to be less than 15 minutes. Everybody has to wear masks, but whoever loses then has to go and clean the equipment.” 

For any student who is having trouble adjusting to the new reality, Franco offered the assistance of the Student Activities Office.

“Our office is staffed Monday through Friday 8 to 4:30. You can always come to the office and you can ask questions,” he said. “We have a professional staff person there every day of the workweek [and the rest of us are working remotely] so we're always an email away.”
