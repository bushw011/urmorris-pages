COVID-19 is converging with climate change and armed conflic to cause global extreme poverty to rise for the first time in decades, according to the World Bank’s report “Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2020: Reversals of Fortune.” The pandemic is projected to create up to 150 million “new poor” by 2021. 

People experiencing extreme poverty live on less than US$1.90 per day. Since 1990, the global poverty rate has decreased from over 35 percent in 1990 to 8.4 percent in 2019. Before COVID-19, global poverty was projected to hit 7.9 percent in 2020. Instead the World Bank estimates that the rate could rise to between 9.1 and 9.4 percent in 2020, and 8.9 and 9.4 percent in 2021.

The crisis is a significant setback in the UN’s goal to reduce global extreme poverty to less than 3 percent by 2030. The report outlines that, with the assumption of a poverty reduction rate similar to 2008-2018, by 2030 the rate will be between 6.7 and 7 percent (although, the report notes that is an optimistic projection). In order to reach the goal of eradicating poverty by 2030, there needs to be “significant, swift, and sustained action to ignite inclusive growth in countries where extreme poverty persists.”

This issue is not restricted to countries that already have high rates of poverty. Approximately 80 percent of the “new poor”—72 million people—will be from middle income countries. A middle income country is a country whose per capita gross national income (GNI) is between US$1,026 and US$12,3755 like India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Nigeria. When the poverty lines for middle income countries are taken into account—the lowest being US$3.20 and the highest being US$5.50—that number greatly increases.

The COVID-19 economic crisis is intensified by climate vulnerability and armed conflict. Climate change and conflict have already been slowing the rate of poverty reduction, and when combined with the COVID-19 pandemic they are reversing years of hard fought advances in poverty reduction. South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are expected to have the highest amount of people being pushed into extreme poverty. Both of these regions have high flood risks, and armed conflict is prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa. Conflict stricken nations have difficulty maintaining wealth because of loss of human capital, gaps in education and conflict debt. When that converges with climate crises and the pandemic, the economic effects can be catastrophic.

In addition to an increase in extreme poverty, there is expected to be a decrease in shared prosperity across most economies. Shared prosperity, defined as the increase in wealth of the poorest 40 percent of a country, was at 2.3 percent in 2012-2017, but is expected to be in the negatives during the next two years. This decline will deepen income inequality and decrease job prospects among those with a basic education.

The report also outlines heightened difficulty in obtaining a basic education. Several countries expect loss of human capital in disadvantaged households, meaning there will be people who are inhibited nutritionally and kept from getting an education.

In a phone survey to seven countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, 40 percent of respondents reported running out of food during the COVID-19 lockdown. This lack of nutrition will continue to cause delays in children’s health, cognitive development and future human capital accumulation.

The profile of people experiencing these issues is changing because of COVID-19. In 2020 and 2021, there are expected to be millions of “new poor” who are employed in nonagricultural fields and live in urban settings. This differs from the typical profile of poverty, which is predominantly made up of people living in rural areas with agricultural jobs.

But even though the profile of the poor is being diversified, the poorest and most vulnerable people before the pandemic are being hit the hardest. This includes people who have escaped or nearly escaped poverty as is seen in Sub-Saharan Africa. That region is expected to see one of the largest growths in “new poor,” just after South Asia, with as many as 40 million people being pushed to live under US$1.90 per day. This economic decline will not be as steep as other countries, but the large number reflects millions of people living just above the poverty line.

Children are also experiencing immense impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, according to UNICEF and Save the Children’s report “Impact of COVID-19 on multidimensional child poverty.” The report measures poverty multidimensionally, taking factors other than finances into account. Their analysis includes things such as lacking access to education, proper nutrition and clean water.

UNICEF reported the rate of children living in multidimensional poverty has risen from 47 percent to 56 percent since COVID-19—that is 150 million additional children experiencing poverty because of COVID-19. The report also describes that it is not just “new poor.” The poorest children are getting poorer.

The Poverty and Prosperity report warns unless serious changes are made, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis could leave lasting scars on countries. The worry is that without action the crisis will create cycles of income inequality, decrease social mobility of the most vulnerable and erase resilience to future shocks.

The World Bank, UNICEF and Save the Children are calling for fast action. Policy changes and protective social programs need to be put in place to help the newly impoverished people in addition to those who were vulnerable before the pandemic.

The Poverty and Prosperity report emphasizes the need to design policies that are targeted for the “new poor” with focuses on creating safety nets, measurements to rebuild jobs and plans to strengthen human capital. The report is calling for research to be directed at specific areas where COVID-19, climate change and armed conflict meet.

Without swift and steady action, the effects of the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic threaten to dismantle years of progress in poverty reduction.
