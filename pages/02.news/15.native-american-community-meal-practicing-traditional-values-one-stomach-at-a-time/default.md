What is the mission of a Community Meal? Is it service? Is it education? Both, neither, a mix of this and something else? 

The Office of Community Engagement (OCE), in cooperation with the Organic Gardening Club (OGC), the Circle of Nations Indigenous Association (CNIA), and the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Intercultural Exchange (EDI), hosted the final community meal of the semester on Monday, November 5. This meal, with a menu selected by students based on foods traditionally a part of their culture, was the product of staff at UMM, students, their communities at home, and the land, not to mention the history that ties all of those components together. 

Eight years ago, the land comprising the Native American Garden was blessed, and to fulfill its mission to share its bounty with the community, the Native American Community Meal was established. Year after year, two student groups have been responsible for the garden and the meal: the Organic Gardening Club and the Circle of Nations Indigenous Association, with the invaluable support of two individuals, Sarah Eckel of the Office of Community Engagement and Mary Jo Forbord of the UMM Wellness Center. 

The process for deciding the menu each year brings together indigenous students, their organizations, staff, and their unique cultures to decide what to serve. Some crops are always grown in the Garden, colloquially known as the Three Sisters: corn, winter squash, and the common bean. These crops are supplemented with food from the students’ communities and some modern ingredients, ones that are widely adopted or helpful in accommodating dietary restrictions. Many of the dishes carry cultural value, as well as unique dietary value, from the history of indigenous peoples in the Americas. This year, the many stakeholders decided to have Deer Meat Gravy as the entrée, which was sourced by a UMM student, Lalania Walker, co-chair of CNIA.

Walker characterized the meal as a chance to connect people and build understanding between cultures. Eckel echoed similar sentiments, hoping that attendees will learn about the cultures of the people who once occupied this place. 

Walker wanted people to acknowledge, understand, and respect the Native American presence in Morris, in particular the sustainable food systems of Minnesotan Native American communities. Forbord also emphasized the modern values that these traditional foods hold. Discussing the food, Forbord said “[T]hey are nutritionally dense, that is, healthful without excess calories… These foods are not only a part of the history of this land and peoples, but a part of our sustainable future.” 

Another cultural component was a part of the meal: language. On the translations accompanying the food, Walker said “I hoped that students and community members were able to learn new Ojibwe and Lakota words with the translations that were provided… I was very thankful for the people who did the translations, because I think that it’s important to also display and speak our Native languages as much as we can.” 

Asked about the meal’s overall traditional character, Walker did admit that frybread is entirely western, but related it to the fight for survival indigenous people faced after being restricted to reservations, away from many traditional hunting and foraging grounds. Apart from frybread, everything else has a traditional character, with the wild rice and deer coming from the White Earth Reservation in particular. On the sources of the food, Walker said, “I think that this aspect of the meal is very important. There was a meaningful connection with the whole process starting from the hunting, planting the seeds, to shelling the beans.” 

Forbord echoed similar sentiments when asked about the goal of the community meal. “The Native American Community Meal is reflective of the entire year when seeds are saved and traded, then planted, tended, harvested, processed, and cooked,” she said. “All this takes a community and lots of hard work, but results in an inclusive, delicious celebration infused with gratitude for the food, the season, and the sharing.” 

All of the work leading up to the meal itself took a community, and another stepped up to prep and cook it. Many students lent their time to prepping, which included cutting roughly a 100 lbs. of potatoes, puréeing 40 lbs. of squash, and cleaning and frying almost 50 lbs. of venison. The kitchen presents quite a scene, with people from many backgrounds fulfilling the mission of the Native American Garden. You would expect a larger community with the amount of diversity the people working contained, but it truly did come of the character of our little university on the prairie. 

346 people were fed this year, thanks to the in-depth involvement of UMM students, their communities, and a mission to honor the first peoples of this country.
