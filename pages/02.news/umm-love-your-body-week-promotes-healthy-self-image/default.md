This past week, the UMM Wellness Center put on Love Your Body Week.  Peer Health Educators (PHEs) Giulia Defant, Ren Carmichael, and Yasamin Graff helped run the events. On Monday, Collage and Craft with the Therapy Dog Team was held. Other events like Mental Health and Stigma, Food in College, and Self Love is Complicated were run by these three individuals and the Wellness Center, as well as other student organizations. 

I sat down with the three PHEs during their Wednesday night event, Pee 4 Pizza and Love, Sex, and Banana Splits in Louie’s Lower Level, an opportunity for free STI tests provided by Mahube-Otwa Family Health. Along with pizza, those who came could pick up condoms or chat with Carmichael about sexual health. Carmichael said getting tested is something anyone should do, regardless of your sexual activity. It doesn’t matter if you are shifting partners, or not non-sexually active, you need to get tested. It is confidential and in an environment where you should not feel judged for caring about your sexual health. 

“This is just like any other checkup” said Carmichael when talking about the importance of getting tested, “It’s just another part of your health.” Like any physical, flu-shot, or doctor appointment, it equally as important to be on top of your sexual health. Getting a diagnosis can alert you of an infection you may have not noticed or suspected. One Medical says that about 1 million people in the US have Hepatitis C, yet they do not know they have been infected. Although hearing you have an STI is upsetting, it can really create a “peace of mind” if you were suspecting you had been at risk. In any situation, getting tested can help you start treatment as soon as possible. 

Carmichael runs events like the Sexpo and Love, Sex, and Banana Splits, all events for students to get confidential advice on how to live a healthy sexual life. This is just one area of the PHE office. Graff is a leader on the stress and mental health side of the Wellness Center. They put on events like Mental Health Awareness Week, and the Stress For Less Floor Program. They also coordinate the therapy dog team, Mercer and Hank, for students’ mental health. On the physical and nutritional health side, Defant is a strong model to the campus. Leading yoga weekly around town and on campus, Defant is a great person to go to for physical health concerns. Her yoga sessions are for any skill-level and they are primarily for stress relief. 

The PHEs all interact to form a coalition of sorts that help students be mindful of their overall health. Their primary form of services are through prevention. They mostly focus on education and advice while occasionally offering intervention and immediate help. An important part of the PHE initiative is educating students on how your health can be threatened. Much of the PHE office revolves around the idea of an intersectionality of health-related issues. “If you’re sexually assaulted, that isn’t always just going to affect your sexual health.” Graff said that it might often affect the other two areas, such as mental (PTSD) or physical (eating disorders). “Mental health does not exist in a vacuum.” 

The Peer Health Educators hold office hours weekly. Carmichael’s hours are from 5p.m.-7p.m. on Wednesdays, Graff’s hours are at 11a.m.-1:30p.m. on Saturdays, and Defant’s hours are on Fridays from 9a.m.-11a.m. Their office is located in Gay Tower 1, lower level, across from the Health Services Office.
