For many years, the University of Minnesota Morris has worked toward creating a gender-inclusive space both in and out of the classroom. An example of this has been the use of preferred pronouns, including a set of third-person pronouns that an individual prefers to use when addressing one’s gender. The University of Minnesota Morris implements the use of preferred pronouns campus-wide through fall orientations, class introductions, activities, programs, and more.

But the University of Minnesota system has made it their goal over the past three years to implement every University of Minnesota campus to apply a similar policy. According to Minnesota Daily writer Niamh Coomey, the policy asks that university community members use the name and gender pronouns preferred by individuals. It also requires that the university be transparent with how data on gender identity is used, and that individuals can participate in activities and use facilities consistent with their gender identity.

However, the main concern revolving around the policy proposal was that it would infringe on First Amendment rights to require the use of preferred names or pronouns. However, the gender equity committee at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities unanimously stated that the “University community has been supportive of the policy.” Overall the policy aims “to support the University’s goal to provide and maintain an environment for University members that is free from discrimination based on gender identity and gender expression.”

The University of Minnesota Senate passed the gender policy proposal back in May 2019. Many student senators such as Austin Berger emphasized that this policy was a “historic” step, telling the Minnesota Daily: “If the regents have concerns about this policy and if any of them would like to nullify it, I think we will have to organize some direct action efforts to ensure this is respected. It’s a pretty loud message when civil service [professional and administrative staff], faculty and students all come together and endorse something like this by an overwhelming majority.”

The final revisions to the policy were implimented on December 11, 2019. Areas of the policy, as described on the University Policy Library, cover the preference of one’s name, gender identity and pronouns, privacy of legal sex and names, and use of preffered pronouns in programs, activities, and facilities.
