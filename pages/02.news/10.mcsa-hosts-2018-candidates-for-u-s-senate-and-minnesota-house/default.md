You can feel it in the crispness of the air, the colors of the leaves, and the attack ads on TV. It is election season. Read to find out more about candidates on your ballot, and remember to register by Tuesday, October 16. 

On October 3, 2018, the Morris Campus Student Association held a forum for candidates running for the U.S. Senate and Minnesota House District 12A to meet the voters and make their cases. The questions were submitted by students of the University of Minnesota Morris and sourced from the Minnesota Newspaper Association. 

Running in the normal Senate election were Republican Representative Jim Newberger and Green Party candidate Paula Overby against incumbent Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Running in the special election to fill the seat of Sen. Al Franken was Independent Jerry Trooien competing against appointed incumbent Sen. Tina Smith. 

In their opening remarks, the candidates all gave a specific reason they were running. Newberger appealed to a sense of balance, claiming that Klobuchar has swung the state too far to the left, leaving moderates and conservatives in the cold. For Overby, reducing our military spending and ending involvement in foreign conflicts, and investing that money in education and healthcare, are her reason for running. Trooien is running to reduce polarization, avoid the cliches of the two parties, and find solutions that everyone agrees on. 

The first question was a reiteration of their opening statements: what is your priority if you are elected to Congress? Overby did not have a very clear platform, reiterating her desire to see stronger third parties. Trooien ruminated on the power of an independent in the Senate, their leverage, and vowed to find a unique voice for Minnesota.  Newberger laid out some of his planks: finding the needs of individual districts, focusing on free market healthcare, and removing barriers to business. 

On Trump’s foreign policy, Trooien is unversed, finding some to support, like North Korea, and some to rebuff, like the Iran nuclear agreement. He is sticking to whatever is the best for Minnesota. Newberger was content with Trump’s policy: Iran, Jerusalem, tariffs, and North Korea. He took the time to criticize Sen. Klobuchar for being involved in the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh at the expense of working on foreign policy. Overby was direct in being against foreign interventions, but did not draw explicit ties to Trump’s policy and the outcomes of past interventions. 

As for education, the candidates were asked about what the role of the federal government is in ensuring U.S. graduates can compete in the global economy. Newberger inveighed against the rising cost of tuition, and hoped that states and the government would do more to ensure public universities remain affordable. He would propose that the cost of each credit be tied to the minimum wage, no more than four times that level. Overby wants to see more education funding, drawing from the funds going toward conflict. Trooien sees too much complexity to make a commitment on education policy. The size of entitlement spending makes it too difficult, based on the difficulty the country is having with deficits right now. He would like for government to have a role, ensuring students are making good wages in their industry, but could not commit to any policy. 

There were many more questions to follow, about deficits, immigration, clean energy, and about Judge Kavanaugh. Some of the more standout responses would be Trooien’s take on Kavanaugh, rejecting his stances on abortion and executive power, while criticizing how Democrats have treated the process. Newberger’s stance on clean energy is that it should be a part of our energy portfolio, but not at the expense of national security or the prosperity of communities dependent on fossil fuels. Overby and Trooien both support the humane treatment and reunification of immigrant families, and Trooien in particular was upset with the distractions of partisanship in the debate. 

In their closing arguments, all three responded to shortcomings they saw in the current Senators. They are handcuffed by partisanship, too interested in winning, and were too quick to decide on a solution or answer instead of considering the options. 

**House District 12A**
The candidates for 12A were given a barrage of questions regarding education, from funding, to comprehensive sexual education, to college debt. Each gave measured answers to these questions, highlighting personal experience in most cases. Smart has a history of helping high schoolers select schools to attend, and the concerns they have about debt. Backer wants to emphasize teaching students about debt beforehand and how to pick and stick with their degree programs. Backer also saw a need to push students toward vocational programs and other non-bachelor degree programs. 

As for funding, the two offered stark differences on how to best approach improving budgets. Backer has served on his local school board, and promotes repealing mandates from the capital, which too often eat budgets without measurably improving outcomes. Returning control to school boards would improve the schools. Smart supports a guaranteed funding level for all school districts, and noted the lack of efficacy the 2% increase to school budgets the legislature recently passed would have after inflation. 

The environment, specifically clean energy, offered some difference, but not as stark due to the differing points of contention. Smart noted the recurrence of disaster in the media, and that action is needed to curb climate change. Working directly with industry to prevent disaster was the best way forward. Smart was offering a structural change to address the problems of climate change. Backer, in contrast, talked about the place for clean energy, and using it wisely in conjunction with the market when investing in infrastructure or offering subsidies. Consumers should pick whatever is cheapest, and having those mixed sources would be more equitable than mandating a proportion of energy to come from clean sources. This would be more of an agent argument for addressing the problem. 

Farming was given as a broad topic, wherein Backer noted his many disagreements with Gov. Dayton, specifically the buffer strip law and other mandates. Smart, however, offered a tempered version of the existing policy, trusting that farmers would accept the changes to limit their impact. He noted that farmers have been good stewards when it came to protecting groundwater, and they could similarly move towards protection of surface water. 

The last policy question had to do with Internet infrastructure here. Smart laid out how it was hurting investments broadly, and that investment from the state could fuel the economy in this regard. Backer agreed, noting the difficulty of working with the large companies to get their investment here. He would like to see more grants offered by the government, and more independent services arise to meet the needs of the community. 
Their closing remarks illustrated how the spirit and ethic of Minnesota are important to their race, and to all the rest. When asked about the most important thing about Western Minnesota to promote, they both answered with the people. Backer wants to see the government invest directly in people, through job agreements and service expansion. Smart, arguably, agrees strongly in spirit, sharing the rate of teacher turnover he has experienced out here. 

Hopefully, a similar spirit of camaraderie permeates the voters this year too.
