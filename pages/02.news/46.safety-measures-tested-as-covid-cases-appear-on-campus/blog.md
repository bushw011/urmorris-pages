Since the beginning of the school year, there have been concerns about the safety of students, staff, and Morris community members. 

Safety measures put in place by the University have been put to the test recently as a few COVID-19 cases have sprung up on campus. Based on information available to the University Register as of September 9, there have been at least three positive cases among the student body since the beginning of the academic year and several students have been placed in isolation. Although COVID-19 cases on campus were inevitable, their appearance has caused students to worry about their safety, the future of the semester, and the possibility of students being blamed for an outbreak.

One major point of student concern originated on August 25, when system administrators locked students across the University of Minnesota network out of MyU until they acknowledged that there was no guarantee that they would not be infected and they would be responsible for paying their student fees, regardless of whether the mode of instruction changed later in the semester. A later message from Executive Vice President and Provost Rachel Croson clarified that the message was not intended to act as a waiver of student rights. The message did not originate from the Morris campus.

In addition to concerns for their rights, students have also expressed many concerns for their health. The university has made multiple accommodations for students attending classes on campus, including providing each student with two reusable masks, ensuring that classrooms are set up to follow social distancing protocol, and regularly sanitizing public spaces. Although the university is not able to provide COVID-19 testing for students, they have connected with the Stevens Community Medical Center to provide testing, and university officials have created on-campus housing for students who need a space to quarantine.

These thirty spaces, known as “Cougar Care,” are dedicated on-campus housing for individuals who have tested positive, appear symptomatic, or have been exposed to someone who has been infected. Students living on campus who have tested positive will be quarantined, while students who have not tested positive will be placed in isolation. According to the University’s COVID-19 Dashboard on August 28, there were between one to five individuals in isolation on campus. This increased to seven individuals in isolation and up to five individuals being quarantined. An unknown number of students are also isolating or quarantining off-campus.
UMM also has other ways of protecting the campus that are outlined in their health protocol, and they emphasize that community behavior is key. To preserve the health of the campus and community, the protocol suggests to wash your hands often, cover your cough and sneeze, avoid face touching, stay home if sick, wear a mask, maintain six feet of distance from others, and avoid crowded areas. 

In a speech given at a Campus Forum Meeting on September 1, University administrators stated that students on campus did not have an elevated risk of being exposed to coronavirus compared to members of the general public. Following campus protocol will make it less likely for students to contract COVID-19 — but not impossible. Since students have returned to campus, COVID-19 cases in Stevens County have increased.

Although Stevens County was one of the last in the state to report a case of COVID-19, cases are now on the rise. Since students have returned to campus, cases in larger Stevens County have more than triple from 22 on August 18 to 78 on September 9. As of writing, cases among students are disproportionately low compared to Stevens County at large, but this increases the likelihood of exposure off-campus.

To better track COVID-19 exposure, contact tracing is being conducted and those who were exposed to an individual who tested positive were notified within 24 hours of the University’s awareness. The Minnesota Department of Health classifies an exposure as being within six feet of an infected individual for at least fifteen minutes. Students who have simply been in the same class as someone who has tested positive will not be considered to be exposed. As of writing, COVID testing is still being conducted exclusively at Stevens Community Medical Center.

Infection rates in Minnesota overall have also increased, causing three of the five U of M campuses to delay student move in for two weeks. The students have returned to the two remaining campuses Morris and Crookston, which have resumed in person classes. 

As of writing, UMM plans to continue teaching in a hybrid mode.
