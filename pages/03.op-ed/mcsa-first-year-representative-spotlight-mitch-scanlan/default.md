**I sat down with Mitch Scanlan, Chemistry and Pre-Med major from Lindstrom, MN. Scanlan was recently elected as one of the Freshman Representatives for the Morris Campus Student Association (MSCA). **

**Are you in any other clubs other than MCSA?**
> I’m in the chemistry club, as well as the Pre-Health club. I also am planning on helping out with the local Boy Scouts in Morris. 

**Describe yourself in three words.**
> “Hardworking, alpha male, jack hammer, merciless, insatiable,” Dwight Schrute.

**What made you interested in the position of first-year rep?**
> I did student government back in high school. I felt like I could have a natural transition into the collegiate level. 

**What are your main objectives as First-year Representative?**
> Honestly, I don’t have any objectives. I’m here to get a lay of the land. I want to build good relationships between the other representatives, my peers, staff, and faculty here. I want to commit to that Morris culture. 

**Would you describe yourself as a social person on campus?**
> I’m probably somewhere more in between an extrovert and introvert. 

**Who are some influential people in your life?**
> My parents are pretty great. Pretty neat. They help me be the best “me” I can possibly be. 

**What would you say to your fellow first-years?**
> Take everything in strife. Live your life. Explore. Embrace Morris and all it has to offer. Try something new. 

**Scanlan is excited for his future at UMM. He hopes to get to know more people and be a friend to all students. Check out the next issue for another article on MCSA Freshman Representatives.**
