Hello all, 

I believe that the concept of “radio broadcasting” ought to be appropriated for our witchcraft. We need to stay ahead of the trends, keep on top of the latest technologies such as radio and burning crude oil to create power. Now I know it’s tempting to attempt this technique with words right away, but I think that using words is too advanced at this stage for most of you. Most of us don’t even know any, much less the words that rip and rend the universe according to our dark desires. It’s best to begin with anguished howls. 

The key to “radio broadcasting” is to understand the nature of the void that exists between every one of us, the vast nothing between skin and skin. No touch ever quite reaches its destination. Within the nothingness there are particles of capitalism, anti-matter. There are flakes of institutional racism floating around, specs of systemic sexism that it’s hard to avoid breathing in. Try to remain aware of this. I don’t know how to fix it, but knowing of its existence is necessary for “radio broadcasting.”

When about to “radio broadcast,” it is best to have an open, peaceful mind. To these ends, I suggest doing something gay, like training toads to attack the upper class when the revolution finally comes. 

Then all you have to do is think about how mothers in Flint are suffering miscarriages because there’s STILL poison in the water. Or about how at least some of the FEMA meals given to Puerto Ricans are composed of Cheez-its and Babe Ruth bars. Yeah, our government gave disaster victims junk food and called it “humanitarian aid”. Victors of a disaster, mind you, created by climate change in turn created by big business, not to even get into the racist, repressive politics levied at the island for over a hundred years now. This will produce the desired anguished howl.

Gays Are Soon to Rule the World, 

The Void Mother
