September is national suicide prevention month, so I would like to take a minute to discuss how our society treats mental health, and depression in particular. 

Unfortunately, we are still living in a society which, as a whole, doesn’t quite seem to accept the brain as its own organ capable of falling ill and developing health issues which require medical assistance. Since people tend to think of the brain and the mind as the same entity, they often hold the false belief that mental health issues can be conquered with a simple display of willpower. They forget that mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, are the result of a neurochemical imbalance, and they mistake them for simple laziness, sorrow, or nervousness. While it would be convenient to be able to vanquish medical
conditions such as these with a surge of determination and positive thoughts, that is simply not effective enough to cure an individual of a condition such as depression.

I don’t mean to say that everyone with depression needs to be taking a certain medication or participating in a certain form of therapy— like all illnesses, depression differs for the individual, and while a myriad of treatments exist, they don’t necessarily work for everyone. Rather, my point is that we need to take mental health as a whole more seriously, and refrain from assuming that simply because one is having an issue with their mental health, they can or should overcome it solely with their mind.

The topic of mental health is especially pertinent to us as college students because depression and anxiety are incredibly common mental health conditions for college students to develop. The combination of academic, social, and financial pressures can be overwhelming, and for many students, these pressures can stimulate mental health issues. As the school year starts and workloads begin to pile up, I urge anyone reading this article to pay attention to their mental health. If
you begin to feel overwhelmed, or if you recognize detrimental signs of a mental health disorder you’ve already been diagnosed with, please take the time to care for yourself. Remember that UMM has multiple outlets to help students deal with mental health problems, from counseling to therapy dogs.

If our society ever causes you to feel that you are at fault for issues with your mental health, remember that it is not a matter of self control, and that if you need support, you are not alone.
