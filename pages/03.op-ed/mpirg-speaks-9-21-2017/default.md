Hey campus, your friends at MPIRG here!

For those of you who aren’t familiar with us, MPIRG is the Minnesota Public Interest Research Group. MPIRG is a statewide, nonpartisan, grassroots advocacy organization. We’ve been getting students and young people involved in the democratic process since 1971. In those 46 years, we’ve done some really cool things! Students in Minnesota helped created the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, pass the first renewable energy standard, shut down coal plants, and turned people out to vote for marriage equality.

I wonder what we can do with your help!

MPIRG meets every Wednesday at 7 p.m. in the Moccasin Flower Room, and this year we’re trying something new! Once a month, we’ll be having an organizing skills training, led by MPIRG Staff, our leadership, or a guest speaker. These help us (and you!) become better leaders and organizers. During another meeting, we’ll host a discussion bed by one of our newly forming caucuses (such as the Interfaith Caucus) about important topics on our campus, community, state, country, and world. Then, twice a month, our campaign teams will meet.

Our generation has to rise to so many challenges that have been left to us, so why should we wait? We are the people that we’ve been waiting for. Join the movement for youth democracy!
