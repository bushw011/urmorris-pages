**Natalie Ogard is a freshman representative elected to the MCSA student council. She is a Political Science major with an emphasis in Pre-Med. She hopes to work in oncology, or possibly be a surgeon. Other than MCSA, she is involved in Black Student Union, United States for Africa, and the Korean culture club. **

**What is the position of first-year rep? What are the responsibilities or tasks that the first year rep may do?**
> We help integrate freshman onto campus and help them and make sure their experience is good. 

**What made you interested in the position?**
> I didn’t know about it initially. A friend told me about it. I was interested in the aspect of leadership. I wanted to get to know other freshman.

**What are your main objectives as first-year rep?**
> I want to enact positive change. There was a recent survey that we sent out to get opinions of students. I really want to find the specific problems that are affecting the freshman. 

**How has student leadership played a role in your life?**
> This is my first real opportunity for student leadership. I’m liking it so far. 

**Who are some influential people in your life?**
> My parents have really motivated and supported me. I’m really thankful to have them in my life. 

**What would you like to say to your fellow first-years?**
> There’s help if you need it. Let other first years know. If anything you are experiencing is troubling you, let us know to make your college experience better. 

**MCSA freshman representatives are tabling in the Student Center to answer any of your questions or concerns. Ogard says that although she may seem initially quiet, she can be very outgoing once you get to know her. She is looking forward to helping freshman across campus. **
