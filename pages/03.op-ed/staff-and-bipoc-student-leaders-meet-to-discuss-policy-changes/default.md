In June 2020, student body president Sam Rosemark released an open letter to the University of Minnesota Morris community, reflecting on the brutal murder of George Floyd, as well as the ensuing worldwide protests and calls to end police brutality and racial injustice. 

A month later, Black Lives Matter signs around Morris were reported to have been defaced and burned —sending a reminder to all residents that racial resentment and discrimination was a problem that even our community struggles with. For many students, these recent events lead to a reflection on the history of our campus—from it’s conception as a Native American boarding school, to the 1993 incident on Halloween. While reflection is important, it must be preceded by action to be meaningful - and that is exactly what administration has set out to do.  

In August, only a few weeks after the vandalism debacle, Rosemark invited myself and dozens of other BIPOC student leaders to attend a conversation with university administration about future policy changes to Public Safety (formerly known as campus police), Student Affairs, Residential Life, and other departments, in response to the growing demand for change. 

UMM’s Public Safety department has a commitment to being a local leader in progress towards ending racial injustice and discrimination in Stevens County and surrounding Minnesota areas. Starting this October, in collaboration with the EDI department, Public Safety will begin hosting trainings centering on power, privilege and identity, as well as crisis management and de-escalation. The Morris Police department and Stevens County Sheriff’s Office are invited to partake in these workshops. 

As part of Public Safety’s efforts to move towards restorative justice, Public Safety Officer Travis Clark, along with the Stevens County Attorney’s Office, are in the final stages of developing a diversion program for students who interact with public safety over underage drinking concerns. This will account for approximately 95 percent of alcohol offenses that would previously have resulted in a citation. 

Residential Life and Student Affairs have made updates to their policies regarding fees, as they oftentimes have a disproportionate effect on students depending on socioeconomic background. Fees will no longer be applied as disciplinary measures, and will only be used under circumstances where additional ORL costs need to be covered (i.e. damaged property). ORL has also updated their alcohol and marijuana response policies—ORL staff can no longer contact Public Safety over the scent of marijuana, and students will not be issued an alcohol possession misdemeanor on their first offense. 

Speaking from the perspective of an Indigenous student leader, I am satisfied that UMM has been quick in their response to recent events. I also believe that including BIPOC student leaders in these discussions has been an incredibly important gesture. While I do believe that some measurements and policy changes lean towards performative  (i.e. changing the name of Campus Police to Public Safety), I think these are incredible first steps in making meaningful change for BIPOC members of the UMM community. 

However, I do believe that these should only be the first steps—it is our responsibility, as a student body, to continue holding the university accountable and challenge their promise of commitment to these conversations throughout the year and beyond. We must also be sure to continue demanding that the entire University of Minnesota system makes necessary, meaningful change, so that we can build a future for academia where all students are treated equally regardless of their race or color of their skin.
