Since the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February, our nation has moved into widespread debate about the nature of truth. Survivors of the tragedy have shown incredible resistance to our nation’s leaders and lobbyists when speaking out against gun violence. Teenagers such as Emma González have demonstrated that youth in today’s society have the potential to influence and lead in times of need. Yet, these teenagers have been accused of being “victim actors,” playing the tragedy for political gain and fame. Despite a surprising amount of encouragement over social media, they continue to be shamed because of their age and the message they preach. These accusations were highlighted in an article by Michael Schulman titled “The Spring Awakening of the Stoneman Douglas Theatre Kids.” The piece prompted me to reflect on how we treat rebellious youth in our schools and how we can foster an environment where students are confident to dissent.

Written in The New Yorker, the article examines the similarities between students in the rock-musical Spring Awakening and the individuals leading the “Never Again” movement. For instance, Schulman observes that much like the gun-control debate in Stoneman Douglas, Spring Awakening also debates over an “unregulated weapon:” sex. Over the course of the musical, Melchior Gabor, a rebellious and driven student, observes how society plays on the ignorance of students by keeping them hidden from obscene and explicit topics such as sex. Wendla Bergmann, a girl blind to the realities of sex who is impregnated by Melchior, dies of a botched abortion. Melchior’s other friend, Moritz Stiefel, commits suicide because he is both overwhelmed by school and his naïve understanding of sex. Standing over his friends’ graves, Melchior sings:

> I’ll walk now with them
> I’ll call on their names
> And I’ll see their thoughts are known
> Not gone
> Not gone.
        	
Schulman does an excellent job of comparing the youth in Spring Awakening to the leaders of the Never Again movement. In both instances, the youth are affected by loss and tragedy and vow to be voices for their deceased friends.
        	
It’s motivating to see the students of Stoneman Douglas calling out the adults for their inability to take action. If I were in their position, however, I don’t know if I would be able to be such a defiant and rebellious leader. I believe that I would be hesitant to speak my beliefs on gun control because of the environment I was socialized in. As a teenager, I and many other students in my school were dependent on the adults in our lives. We looked to them for advice, worked for them at summer jobs, and adopted their political beliefs as our own. The adults in our early lives have had an enormous effect on our development and how we view the world.
        
In the article, Schulman references Steven Sater, the lyricist for the musical, Spring Awakening. Sater says that the author of the original Spring Awakening play could have imagined young heroes like the Stoneman Douglas students, “capable of standing so strong, of speaking the bald truth to the ever-collected, if contorted, face of power.” I worry that students in my community wouldn’t fight for their lives in a situation like this. I worry that after a tragedy, they would do little for a call to action because they were raised to neutralize arguments and avoid conflict. In a community strung together with gun-rights advocates, it is hard to believe that students in my community would be brave enough to voice their concern against the adults that determine much in the course of their lives.
        	
We can see why teenagers would be hesitant to take action. With the proposition of national high school walkouts, many high schools have been quick to say that any protest by students will be met with swift consequences. In the history of my high school, our faculty would repeatedly discourage any form of student protest after nationwide controversies. After one semester of college, I can see how this deteriorates a necessary component of social defiance in students.
        	
Even within the classroom, dissent was often frowned upon. Instructors advised us that we would be gaining “critical thinking skills” in our classes, tossing the term into nearly every course description. Oddly enough, it seemed as if these pedagogies were formatted around the teacher’s critical thoughts, not the students’. For example, after reading a classic play in a composition class, the instructor gave us her interpretation of the text and how she critically approached it. Instead of encouraging students to form critical thoughts of their own, the instructor expected them to adopt her response to the play. I noticed this pattern of conformity throughout many of my classes and it hindered the students’ abilities to speak, think, and write critically. A skill like this is often a stepping stone to rebelling or dissenting from mainstream opinions. How are students who haven’t practiced such skills ready to defend themselves in arguments that divide us, like the gun control debate?
            
In the article, Schulman makes a statement in the margins of a picture: “Many of the leaders of the Never Again movement are indeed actors, thrust into roles that no teenager should have to play.” Yes, students should never experience a school shooting. They should never have to defend themselves or the lives of their friends in a situation like this. While the tragedy is horrible, Stoneman Douglas students are modeling what makes a truly influential and effective person: defiance. Their stability and bravery in their fight with national organizations and powerful political figures ignites a desire for change. It reflects the urgency and necessity for a rebellious youth in our society, encouraged by adults that challenge them to think for themselves.
