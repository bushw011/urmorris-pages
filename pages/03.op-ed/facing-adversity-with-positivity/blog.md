This week, I attended the interview UMM seniors Bailey Kemp and Sarah Severson conducted with David Ebershoff, the author of "The Danish Girl."

For those of you who don’t know, "The Danish Girl" is a biographical novel inspired by the life of Lili Elbe, a transgender woman who, in the 1930s, became one of the first people in history to undergo what we now refer to as gender confirmation surgery.

Ebershoff wrote the book in the late ‘90s after hearing about Lili’s life and feeling that her story needed to be told. The novel won the Lambda Literary Award for Transgender Fiction and the Rosenthal Foundation Award, and was also made into a movie in 2015. I saw the film in theatres, and am currently trying to track down a copy of the novel to read. The movie meant a lot to me when I first saw it, and watching a clip shown during the interview, I couldn’t help but think of how much it still means to me, and how relevant its themes are to our modern society.

One of the themes of The Danish Girl was Lili’s interactions with medical professionals of the late ‘20s and early ‘30s. At that time, the word “transgender” didn’t exist, although transgender people certainly did. Because of this, most of the doctors Lili interacted with misdiagnosed her with various disorders which did not apply to her and even proposed drastic, harmful treatments such as lobotomies to ‘treat’ her.

What Lili was looking for was a way for the medicine of her time to help her biology match her gender identity, but what she endured instead was an onslaught of misunderstandings, biases, and authority figures who (perhaps with what they thought to be good intention) would have harmed her under the guise of medicine.

Today, medical professionals are much more informed and understanding of transgender patients, although the situation is far from perfect. Biases still exist and not all transgender people are recieving the quality healthcare they deserve, whether it be for a minor checkup or for a major procedure such as a gender confirmation surgery.

However, identifying as transgender (or any non-cisgender identity, for that matter) is typically no longer immediately misdiagnosed as a mental disorder such as schizophrenia. Even so, there are still people today who believe that identifying as anything other than cisgender qualifies as a mental illness rather than a legitimate gender identity.

The fact that this blatantly incorrect belief still persists today deeply disturbs me, and I struggle to come up with any reaction to it than poorly-contained outrage. But when I approached Ebershoff after the interview and asked him how he responds to the fact that some people today still believe that the trans identity is a mental illness, his answer was surprisingly positive.

He told me that although it breaks his heart that people still believe that, we need to remember that there are two sides to the issue. There are places where trans people are ostracized and persecuted for their gender identities, but there are also places where they are accepted, welcomed, and loved. He told me that we need to work to add to the latter to diminish the former, and that we can do this simply by talking about these issues, by refusing to be silent in the face of reasonless hatred and adversity.

I greatly admire Ebershoff ’s response, as well as his thoughtfulness and lack of anger when dealing with a mindset which I find to be infuriating. Although he clearly disagreed with the misinformed viewpoint, he handled it tactfully and with an inspiring tone of positivity which I am trying to adopt into my own processing of this adversity.

This isn’t to say that I’m not still angry — I am. I’m just trying to face this issue by adding to the community I believe to be the right one: the community which welcomes and accepts trans people, and doesn’t strive to convince others that their own perception of self is unacceptable, and I encourage all of you to do the same.
