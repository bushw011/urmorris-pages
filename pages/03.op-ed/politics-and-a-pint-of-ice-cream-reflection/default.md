On Feb 27, Pol Sci Club/Pi Sigma Alpha continued their “Politics & a Pint (of Ice Cream)” film series, this year focusing on movies that look at the ethical dilemmas of election cycles and campaigning. What goes better with the disappointment, stress, and horrors of an election cycle than a cup of Blue Bunny vanilla ice cream topped with sprinkles?

The first in the series is the 2012 political drama “Game Change,” a film that chronicles the 2008 McCain campaign’s decision to bring polarizing Alaskan governor Sarah Palin on board as John McCain’s running mate. While the John Heilemann and Mark Halperin book the movie is based upon provides an objective and unbiased account of the McCain campaign, associate professor Roger Rose warned the audience “to not expect pure objectivity out of a Hollywood movie about the Republican Party.”

Although unorthodox, I thought it was an incredibly bold choice to cast Sarah Palin as herself in her own biopic, and it was a choice that paid off well. At least that was what I thought before researching the film online and learning that the role of Sarah Palin was actually played by Julianne Moore, who completely disappeared into the role and accomplished the Herculean task of making me sympathize with Sarah Palin.

To me, the most fascinating aspect of the film was the brief look into Palin’s reception among the Republican Party at the time. There were several scenes highlighting the vice presidential candidate’s popularity among working class, right-wing voters. One must wonder whether Sarah Palin’s vice president candidacy played a role in the rise of the Trump administration, which was credited for mobilizing Southern, working class, conservative-leaning voters in the 2016 election.

“Game Change” was a solid start in the three part film series. The next installment will be the 2011 film, “The Ides of March,” which chronicles the frantic last days of a contested Ohio presidential primary, where a campaign press secretary played by Ryan Gosling is found in a political scandal that threatens his candidate’s presidency chances. I encourage all to attend the next two events, if not for the politics, then for the ice cream.
