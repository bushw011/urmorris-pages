**By Peter Truckenmiller, Writer** _originally published in Issue 5, Volume 30 of The University Register on Friday, November 17, 2017_

*The views and opinions of this letter are my own, and not necessarily those of the organizations mentioned hereafter, including but not limited to, Queer Devil Worshipers, The University Register, and the University of Minnesota Morris.*

I heard y’all are pressed. I heard that you’re angry about a leftist skew on campus. I even heard that you’re mad because some people refuse to tolerate y’alls political views. I can’t say I’m surprised. But I am quite pleased that people refuse to support the immense levels of intolerance that comes out of your organization. “But free speech,” you say. Sure. You have the right to say what you want, it’s true. But you can’t force people to listen. And you cannot force people to agree with you. Sometimes people just don’t want to publish racist and homophobic things. And sometimes, just sometimes, you violate a contract multiple times and just maybe get your right to speech suspended because of that.

Listen. I feel sorry for you. I really do. I mean, at the end of the day you’re all just stuck in the past. The world is changing, and it’s a world where if you’re racist, if you’re homophobic, transphobic, what have you, you’re going to face opposition. 

You might say, “but Peter, we need receipts.” Maybe your friends need some more proof. Maybe by some miracle or the planets aligning, Stevie Nicks in all her blazing glory demands I cite my sources. 

No? Alright. A guy can dream. 

Well, I’m gonna break it down. I cannot possibly begin to cover all of your antics as I am but a humble freshman who occasionally goes on four-day Antiques Roadshow benders and misses important news. Fortunately for a two-bit Nellie Bly like myself, you conveniently leave examples of these actions scattered across the internet. Personally, I don’t know of many racist actions that you have been attributed to, so I will not pretend to know all of them. There are better people for this, and I am not an expert. However, I am aware you have a video on your official public Facebook that includes the use of racial slurs. There may be more examples of your racist behavior, there may not be, but those are details left to someone who can go into more depth in the future. What I can do is address how your organization is homophobic and transphobic, as many more examples of this crop up from just a light amount of digging. 

We’ll start with Coming Out Week. 

Historically, Coming Out Week has been a week for members of the LGBTQIA+ community to come out and promote a basic form of political activism by coming out to family, friends, and colleagues. The general consciousness is to raise awareness and promote acceptance of a marginalized community, and has been a tradition for almost 30 years. You may or may not be aware of this longstanding legacy, but you chose to start an event that openly mocks the intentions of this meeting, as well as LGBTQIA+ members of campus. I’m sorry if there is an event on campus which does not explicitly cater to you. It was never illegal in this country to be Republican, or to practice Republican ideals. Coming out as Republican will not put your life in danger. Coming out as Republican will not incur the death penalty, which is something that the United States did not vote against at a UN meeting in October. If you still wish to raise awareness of the supposed hardships of being Republican, do it in a way that doesn’t openly mock other student organizations, shown by the flyers posted in school halls and online advertising your events. 

Your organization also openly supports known homophobic and transphobic people, as well as posts content where your group is actively being homophobic and transphobic. Now I’m not going to analyze the Republican party; hell, I’m not even going to analyze the president. There is enough online discourse about that, and I highly doubt I could come up with anything that doesn’t apply a blanketed statement. Instead, I am going to focus exclusively on material posted on your Facebook group. 

You have posted footage of you saying transphobic slurs on multiple occasions. You refuse to acknowledge people’s proper names and pronouns, yet claim in your own publications that you are not transphobic. You support and have bragged in videos about speakers who refer to trans people as being mentally ill, something which is transphobic to the core. With the situations mentioned above, your club has been shown to actively be promoting and spreading hate speech. Does the constitution say you can’t say these things? No. But the constitution was also written by the same people who decided that slavery was legal, and that these slaves only counted as 3/5ths of a person so take that as you will. Besides, you already have a place where you can express your ideas, a lovely paper called The North Star. (I, for one, am a massive fan. I keep at least 10 copies in my room at all times. After all, it’s perfect for lining birdcages, wrapping dead fish, and even soaking up pesky blood stains. Honestly, I love using it as kindling when I have a flag that I just REALLY need to burn.)

Now back to this club who had a lot to say about QDW the other day. CR, what’s good? Honestly you can say a lot about us, it’s true. We do in fact REALLY hate capitalism and we really like supporting the equality of all people, so thanks for the shoutout there. You can call us a group of socialists sure. But calling out our fashion? You’ve gone too far. Despite the fact that the personal aesthetics of the members of QDW are both comfortable and stylish, you’re scraping the bottom of the barrel if the worst you can say about us is “They look funny.” But enough about the fashion, let’s get back to the real issues. As I’ve stated above, you’ve shown yourself to be blatantly homophobic, transphobic, and racist, and clearly are not ashamed of this, seeing as you proudly post this information online. However, you still get angry when people don’t like you, or connect you to openly racist actions on campus. If you’d like for people to stop assuming the worst, then work on yourselves. Focus on things that better society, not regress it. 

In the wise words of legendary drag queen Morgan McMichaels; “...go fix your hair… fix your mug.” In this case, I am not referring to a messy eyeshadow or an ashy foundation, but an outward club appearance and reputation. Clean your act up. The world will be better for it, and people will respect you more. 

Your local angry queer,
