I don’t think of myself as a political person. Sure, I have opinions, and many of those opinions could probably be categorized as political ones, but I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about that, nor do I claim to understand much of what goes into politics. I don’t feel the need to label these opinions as political, and usually, I don’t even think many of my opinions are necessary to express to others. I call this being an introvert, but really, it doesn’t matter what label I give it. What matters is that being at Morris has forced me to evaluate my political views, and not because of any class I took or for any other academic reason, but because of the hateful messages I have seen displayed throughout campus.

As many of you have undoubtedly noticed, there has been a bit of a poster war in the tunnels recently. The most recent battle began with rainbow posters declaring that the reader’s identity was valid. It was a simple message, and I found it a pleasant bit of support to read as I walked to class. But a few days ago, I noticed that there were new posters — same format, same color scheme, but with an entirely different message. These posters claimed that the reader’s gender was what they were born with.

I have a lot of things to say about these posters, but I’ll try to keep it concise. I’m going to ignore the fact that the posters’ wording doesn’t really make sense when you think about it — I assume that they are meant to be transphobic posters, but their phrasing doesn’t exactly make that point. They forget that gender and sex are two different things (and even if the people who created the posters don’t believe that, they should at least understand how to argue in terms that make their position clear). One could argue that if a transgender person has always identified with the gender they currently identify with, then they would have had the same gender their whole lives — it’s just that their sex didn’t align with it, causing others to assign the wrong gender to them. But I’ve digressed. While I do have great issue with the transphobic nature of these posters, that is not what I began writing to discuss.

The original posters, as I have stated, have a simple message: Your identity is valid. And yes, I understand that that sentence is applicable to gender identity, and that they were quite probably created as a way to tell readers that their gender identity or sexual orientation is valid, given the rainbow text. But other than the color choice, the posters don’t state anything about either of those forms of identity. They are simply telling the reader that their identity is validated, even if others have told them otherwise, and that they have permission to be who they are. Now, I don’t think that a person should need permission to be who they are, but I agree that it’s nice to have someone who accepts you, regardless.

The new posters took that message of validation and respect and turned it into a message of hate. And I don’t care which political party you affiliate yourself with — I just don’t think that anyone should be able to tell others that they are living their lives incorrectly. This is a college campus; students are supposed to grow, learn, and develop here. Instead, they are closing themselves off from opportunities to expand their worldviews, choosing to immerse themselves in animosity. And while I don’t expect this editorial to change anything, I wanted to leave my readers with this message: Whoever you are, however you identify in any aspect of your life, you are valid, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
