I’m sure many of you have seen the news regarding the incredibly harmful posters that have been showing up around the University of Minnesota-Morris campus. These posters have been targeting students of color, queer students, female-identifing students, and most recently survivors of sexual assault. Posters like this can be damaging and triggering to many students, especially survivors of power-based violence. As students, it can often feel like there is only so much we can do in the face of violence. That being said, each of us has the power to stand up, step in, and speak out.

Unspoken Voices has created a few different posters of our own to show that survivors, students within marginalized communities, and their allies do not have to take this disrespect quietly. The hateful messages that have displayed around campus are disgusting and should not be tolerated. It should also be mentioned that messages of this nature are not new to the University of Minnesota Morris campus, which is unfortunate. It is time now for us to act and provide support for one another. Community is what brings all of us together and lifts us up when we feel there is nothing that can be done. We are not alone when we speak out.

Let’s show the campus and the community that we believe survivors and stand with marginalized communities. Nobody should feel silenced by hate or jokes about violence.

If you are a survivor, we believe you. If you are queer, we see you. If you are part of a community that is experiencing this continual marginalization, we are hurting with you and for you. Please take care of yourself and each other during this time and remember that you are not alone.
