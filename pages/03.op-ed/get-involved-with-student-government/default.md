Friday, March 12 is the last day to file to run for student government this year, and I just want to go on a brief spiel about how cool it can be and why you, dear reader, should more thoughtfully consider getting involved for next year.

I think a lot of students get hung up on the idea that in order to participate in student government, there needs to be a selection and initiation process. But really, it’s best to just dive in. If the inner workings of the campus or the University have ever even momentarily interested you, it might be worth dipping your toes in and accepting that there will be a mild learning curve.

It might be a lot to run for Student Body President unless you know you want to do that, but there are great entry-level positions in the Student Senate and the Consultative Committee.

But I really want to sell you on Campus Assembly, which is a one hour per week plus one hour per month commitment. It puts you on the MCSA Forum, the governing body of the student government, but it also makes you one of twenty students voting on the governing body of the entire campus with the administration, faculty, and staff. Right now they’re discussing changing the campus poster policy at least somewhat in response to recent-ish debacles related to the College Republicans. That’s important!

It’s not just important work, but it’s a great way to learn about your college and take more pride in it. It’s a great way to meet new people and to feel like you’re somebody on this campus. If you’re graduating soon, it’s a nice cherry on top of your college career and a nice little line in your resumé if you’re into that.
There should be an email in your inbox from Election Commissioner Gabby Holboy with details about signing up. Please consider it!
