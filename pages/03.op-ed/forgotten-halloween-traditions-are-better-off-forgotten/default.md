I’ve always enjoyed Halloween. But as a child, going door-to-door dressed as a Harry Potter book or a dinner table, I never questioned why we celebrate it. When I looked into it, I found that some of our current Halloween traditions have interesting origins, and there are other forgotten Halloween traditions that we are better off without.

Halloween began as All Hallows Eve, the night before All Saints Day. Trick-or-Treating was the product of a few different traditions — it stemmed from a festival in England where poor citizens would beg for food, which was usually provided to them in the form of “soul cakes” if they promised to pray for the providing family’s dead relatives. The tradition of dressing up was incorporated into this because people were afraid that Halloween night (which used to be the night before the next year began) was the only night in which the dead could return to Earth. Many people decided to dress as ghosts or monsters before leaving their homes so that if a malevolent spirit saw them, they would hopefully mistake the human for another ghost and leave them be.

In addition to the traditions we continue to celebrate today, Hallows Eve also had traditions we no longer follow, and are better off without. 

Not only was Halloween about the dead and their one-day opportunity to walk amongst the living, but it was also used to serve a matchmaking purpose. In Scotland, young women used to cast walnuts into a fire — one for each of their suitors — and the way the walnuts reacted to the fire was said to represent the women’s futures in love. In some areas, it was said that the walnut which burned to ashes without popping would represent the suitor who the woman would marry while in other areas, the same walnut was said to represent the love that would fail.

Young women also used to toss apple peels over their shoulders on Halloween night, hoping that the peels would fall to form the peels of their future husband. Some women would make a dessert out of sugar-coated walnuts and hazelnuts, which was said to cause prophetic dreams of one’s future husband if eaten before the woman slept that night.

These traditions have since faded, leaving us with rituals of mock horror and free candy in their place. Personally, I think this is for the best. Though the matchmaking traditions may seem just as innocent as the traditions which we still follow today, they perpetuate a dangerous and outdated mindset — that a woman cannot entirely be a complete person until she is married, and married to a man. History is full of traditions created to objectify women or perpetuate the idea that a woman needed to marry early in order to have any hope at a good future. And while many women choose to marry at a wide range of ages, which they certainly have the right to do, all people are fully capable of securing a wonderful future for themselves, regardless of their gender or marital status. 

Especially in current times, we need to be aware of gender discrimination as it affects people of all gender identities and try as hard as we can to keep it out of the traditions which will influence the behavior and mindsets of posterity.
