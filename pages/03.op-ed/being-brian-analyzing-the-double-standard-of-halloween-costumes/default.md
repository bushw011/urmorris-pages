I’m not the biggest Halloween fan. I lived on an Indian reservation, and trick-or-treating back home was always problematic because of the rez dogs (stray canines that wreak havoc and eat trash) chasing me away before I could approach a house. There is one thing about Halloween I really love, though: costumes.

I feared that the tradition would finally lose its novelty for me this year. From fat Tobey Maguire Spider-Man at age nine, to fat Tom Holland Spider-Man at age eighteen, it felt as if I have already worn every possible Halloween costume. I thought this Halloween would be the one where I was forced to desperately resort to buying a Mia Wallace wig and calling myself Bob Dylan. That was until my epiphany during an emergency meeting with my WLA professor Brian Twenter.

While Brian warned me that my extraordinarily low class attendance rate has already guaranteed failure of his course or whatever, I brainstormed possible costume ideas; being Bob Dylan would feel too much like a defeat. I noticed that Brian was wearing an orange shirt that read “TREATIES - Have you honored yours yet?,” a spoof of the Wheaties breakfast cereal box from a popular Native American streetwear brand, The NTVs. It served as further evidence towards my theory that Brian
stole his entire style from my leksi (word for “uncle” in Lakota)... I realized that I owned that shirt too.

It was settled. For Halloween, I would be Professor Brian J. Twenter. Since Brian is a Circle of Nations Indigenous Association advisor and an Indigenous studies professor, my chances of winning CNIA’s costume contest would be high. The only major cost would be purchasing a pair of his iconic orange crocs.

In WLA the next day, while the rest of the class workshopped their essays, I thought about the hilarious irony of a Native American dressing up as a white man for Halloween. I examined the double standard: why should I, a Sicangu Lakota, be allowed to dress like my white college professor when a white woman can’t wild out in her sexy Pocahontas costume?

I admittedly have no insight on the struggles of the liberal arts professor. (I would ask Brian but I want to delay the uncomfortable “I am dressing up as you” conversation for as long as possible.) But I am certain none of it compares to Native children being stolen from their families and taken to boarding schools, where they would be stripped of their culture and traditions and tortured or murdered for resisting. The trauma associated with the boarding schools is very recent, with the last of the institutions being closed at the end of the 1970s. The idea that any person can use Native American imagery and stereotypes to play Indian whenever they want, when only a few decades ago real Indigenous people were killed for the culture that these costumes are lampooning, is absurd. 

Native American women are oversexualized and fetishized in Western culture. From the Disney movie Pocahontas to the Native American princess costumes sold at Halloween Express outlets, the perception of Native American women as “scantily clad and exotic” is prevalent and incredibly dangerous. According to an Amnesty International Study, one out of three Native American women are raped in their lifetime, and Native women are 2.5 times more likely to be sexually assaulted 
than other women. Most Native American costumes reinforce this dangerous perception of Indigenous women and are therefore complacent in rape culture.

On the surface, the argument that if Viking costumes or English professor costumes are allowed, then Native American costumes should be fair game sounds reasonable. But when you take into account the historical context and the problems Native Americans face today, it should not be hard to understand why we say: my culture is not your costume.
