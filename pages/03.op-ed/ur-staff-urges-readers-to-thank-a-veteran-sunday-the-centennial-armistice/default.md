This Sunday, November 11, marks both Veteran’s Day and the centennial of the Armistice ending the first World War, signed on November 11, 1918. In 1954, what was “Armistice Day” became “Veterans Day,” creating the holiday as we know it now. Veterans Day is a day to honor to the sacrifices and commitments of veterans and to thank them for their service. We would like to take this opportunity to reach out to the veterans in our lives and thank them for their service, and to remind the non-veteran members of our readership to take a moment to appreciate the veterans in their lives as well.

This Veterans Day, consider visiting an area dedicated to veterans, such as the monuments in Morris which allow visitors to absorb the scope of the commitments of veterans in the area. There is a garden monument near Spooner Hall and the Education building, and there is a monument near the corner of College Ave and E 7th Street.

Visiting monuments can be a great way to reflect upon the importance of veterans privately, or with a small group of people, but there are also ways to celebrate Veterans Day with an entire community of people. This year, there will be just such an event to allow members of the Morris community come together to acknowledge Veterans Day.

Students and faculty of UMM will be holding a concert open to both the campus community and the Morris community. On November 11 from 3-4 p.m., UMM Symphonic Winds and Concert Choir will be putting on an Armistice Centenary Commemoration Concert at Morris Area Elementary School Concert Hall. The doors will open at 2:30 p.m., and in the half hour leading up to the concert, there will be a slideshow of artifacts and information from World War I. Between pieces, students and faculty will perform readings about World War I.

Some businesses will also be offering discounts to veterans in order to say thank you. In downtown Morris, Pizza Ranch will be offering a free buffet on Monday, November 12 for veterans and active military.

Although Veterans Day is intended to bring the sacrifices of veterans to our attention, that doesn’t mean that your appreciation can’t extend past the 24 hours of November 11.
If you would like to find ways to help veterans at any time, a good place to start could be the VFW at https://www.vfw.org/ or the Wounded Warrior Project, a project which helps disabled veterans. Find them at https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/ Stevens County also has a department of Veterans Affairs, available both online and in person. But the best and easiest way to find out how you can help may be to ask a veteran. 

Perhaps the most immediate, yet simple way that you can show your support is to thank a veteran. Join us in thanking veterans for the sacrifices. Join us in thanking veterans for their service.

Thank you.

Unfortunately, veterans often feel alienated and out of place. Some return with post-traumatic stress, or other barriers to happy lives. Although the exact numbers and the core causes are disputed, most sources agree that veteran suicide rates are much higher than that of the general population. If you or a veteran in your life ever feel depressed and as though you have no place left to turn to, reach out to friends or family or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255, or call 911 in an emergency.

It is more important than ever to make sure that our veterans know that we value their service, we value their sacrifice, and we value the veterans themselves.

To veterans everywhere, we would like to say again, thank you.
