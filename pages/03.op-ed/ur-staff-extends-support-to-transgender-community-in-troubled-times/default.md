In light of recent events, The UR staff would like to extend our support to the transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming communities both on campus and throughout the nation.

Earlier this month, it was revealed that the Trump administration plans to redefine the legal definition of gender. Currently, in the eyes of the law, a person’s gender identity is not necessarily tied to the gender they were assigned at birth. This means that, for the most part, trans and gender nonconforming people are able to legally express themselves the way that they identify and under laws like Title IX, an individual cannot be discriminated against because of their gender identity. Under the current definition, an individual who is trans or gender nonconforming is protected from discrimination for their gender identity (protection is the key word here because some members of the Trump administration feel that these people were wrongly given protection).

According to The New York Times, “For the last year, the Department of Health and Human Services has privately argued that the term ‘sex’ was never meant to include gender identity or even homosexuality, and that the lack of clarity allowed the Obama administration to wrongfully extend civil rights protections to people who should not have them.”

If the Trump investigation succeeds, gender identity will be legally redefined as unchangeable, directly related to one’s assigned gender at birth, and determined by one’s genitalia at birth. While the motion to change the definition has yet to be formally proposed and if proposed, will likely undergo a 60-day period in which it will be open for public comment before it is able to move forward, that does not mean that we should not take the proposal seriously. This is a critical time for people everywhere to show support for the transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people in their lives, and to get involved with LGBTQ+ rights.

For trans students on campus, here are a few resources which Adrienne Conley kindly shared on behalf of the LGBTQIA2S+ Programs and Queer Issues Committee:
“The student health insurance plan provides a number of options for hormone replacement therapy. We understand that accessing appropriate trans-positive and affirming healthcare can be difficult in a rural area.  We encourage students to check out the Minnesota LGBTQ Directory for guidance on seeking health-related resources in Minnesota.

We encourage students to seek support from Student Counseling.  Appointments can be made by visiting their office in 235 Behmler or by calling 320-589-6060.  Counselors have participated in LGBTQIA2S+ training, are active with Queer Issues Committee, and provide ongoing support to our LGBTQIA2S+ support group.  Students may attend the next peer-led LGBTQIA2S+ support group on Monday, October 29 at 8 PM.

Students are able to receive financial assistance through Student Assistance Grants for Emergencies (SAGE).  This fund provides grants for students experiencing financial emergencies.  Information about the SAGE Grant and how to apply will be available through One Stop at the end of today.

Additionally, we provide financial support for LGBTQIA2S+ students in need through an LGBTQIA2S+ Emergency Fund organized through our Queer Issues Committee.  We will help students with financial support on a variety of issues related to name changes, prescription assistance, and other trans-supportive needs.”
Whatever your gender identity, whatever your personal definition of gender, The UR staff would like to let you know that we see you, we support you, and we are here with you in this difficult time. We will be here through the next few months as this motion progresses — or hopefully, doesn’t — and we, along with many other people on campus, offer our unwavering support. You are not unwanted, you are not powerless, and you are not alone.
