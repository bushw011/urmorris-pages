Damn, but if context isn’t key. Let me explain what I’m getting at with that headline. 
If I were to ask you to think of some demographic groups that have it disproportionately rough in today’s world, straight white guys would probably not come to mind. This isn’t without reason. It’s never been illegal to be straight; guys don’t have to worry about things like getting paid less than their female counterparts for putting in the same amount of work; and, to say the ABSOLUTE LEAST that I could on the topic of race, I have not once seen a store manager stalk a white person through their establishment, but have—on multiple occasions—watched store employees tailing people of color while they shopped. 

In short—and I know this will blow most of your minds when I say this—straight white guys experience privilege that many other people don’t. With that being said, I also think straight white guys have caught enough flak for being straight white guys.

I’m talking about the straight white guy jokes. We, as a campus, are great about understanding social issues and accepting others, regardless of things like sexual orientation, gender identity, and race, and yet I hear my classmates making straight white guy jokes on the daily. 

Why is this? Because straight white guys deserve it? Because their inherent privilege means they can stand to be picked on a bit? Because it’s only fair that they spend some time being the butt of a joke for once?

I don’t think so. I don’t think anyone should ever be made to feel inferior over an immutable aspect of their identity, period. And make no mistake, whether they let on or not, the straight white guys whose collective fashion sense, Tinder game, and assumed ignorance you mock, do walk away feeling unfairly judged and ostracized from their fellow students. 

This bums me out for two reasons. The first, I’m only my sexual orientation away from being lumped into this same category of “clueless dummies” by people who claim to be more accepting and compassionate than I am. The second, some of the most caring, “woke,” and all-around-kick-ass friends and allies I’ve had as a gay guy have told me they’ve felt “less than” as a result of this campus’s rampant, straight, white guy-bashing, and this is unacceptable.

And you may be wondering, not without reason, why I’m working so hard to defend straight white guys—who I’ve already established benefit from privilege—when there are minority groups who may have more actual need in the grand scheme of things. That would be a fair question, but the answer is simple; Morris isn’t the grand scheme of things. 

We’re a very, _very_ liberal, _liberal arts_ school, and, as a whole, our students understand that prejudice of any kind is, put simply, fucking stupid. I don’t have to worry about enduring much gay-bashing here; I don’t overhear my classmates telling each other black, Asian, or Mexican jokes; and—four or five problem children aside—I have yet to hear of anyone doing anything short of their utmost with remembering their classmates’ preferred pronouns. 

So please, Morris, understand that it is only with the knowledge that we already do pretty damn well raising each other up on this campus, that I’m asking us to do even better at not tearing each other down. Please consider that, before you need a punchline for your next joke, maybe even the straight white guys have had enough.

Sincerely,
