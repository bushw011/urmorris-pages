**By Matthew Sheets, MPIRG** _originally published in Issue 6, Volume 30 of The University Register on Friday, December 8, 2017_

> “It doesn’t make sense, with the amount of money that the University has, that what they give me isn’t even close to a livable wage. I shouldn’t have to worry about having to make rent at the end of the month, but I do. I am tired of poverty wages.” - Dale Timms, Food Service Worker at UMTC campus.
 
Dale Timms is a full time, University of Minnesota Twin Cities Food Service Worker. He is a father of two and a husband. He makes less than $12.50 an hour, which is $8.66 under Minneapolis’ established minimum livable wage. He is one of 155 campus workers represented by the Teamsters Local 320 union that makes less than $15.00 an hour. Dale and his fellow workers in Teamsters Local 320, which is a union that represents workers from many different departments across campus, have been trying for months to bargain with the University Administration for a wage increase and general respect. After negotiating for seven months and receiving little to no movement on the part of the University, Dale and his fellow workers of Teamsters 320 voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike. This action wa taken as the workers go into one more round of mediated bargaining to try and reach an agreement with University Administration, and will take effect if they cannot reach an agreement that gives the workers what they need.

Workers from Teamsters 320 are not the only campus workers who have been experiencing the unfair labor practices that the University Administration has been choosing to employ. During the last two contract negotiation meetings between AFSCME 3800 campus clerical workers union and the University representatives, it became clear that the University was refusing to bargain in good faith and flat out refused to bargain on any wage increase other than their own proposed plan. 

These contract negotiations come at a time when the University is in the middle of a four billion dollar fundraising campaign, has implemented a general tuition increase of around 2% for in-state students, as well as discussing a 15% tuition increase for out of state students.

This action taken by President Kaler and the University’s Administration is an attack on the rights of the working individuals that keep our campus communities. We as students are the direct beneficiaries of the labor that the workers on our campus give. We are also the main source of income for the University that is creating a toxic work environment for our campus workers. We as students have the duty to stand with people like Dale Timms and all of the working individuals who make our scholarship possible and their families. 

There are a few easy things that you can do to show your support for people like Dale and all of our campus workers. First, you can wear green every Friday to show that you stand in solidarity with the working people of AFSCME 3800 and all campus workers. Second, you can talk with your friends about the way our campus workers are being treated by the University Administration and share Dale Timm’s story across your personal network. Third, you can get involved with workers solidarity efforts that are taking place on campus, such as MPIRG’s own efforts. Come to our weekly meetings to learn how you can help out with our solidarity efforts. We meet in the Moccasin Flower Room, just off of Louie’s, every Wednesday night at 7:00 p.m.

Below is Statewide MPIRG’s full statement supporting our campus workers:
 
> “MPIRG, the students that it represents, and all affiliated student chapters at U of M Twin Cities, U of M Duluth, and U of M Morris stand in solidarity with the working people of our campus communities. The workers on every campus are the individuals that make each of our campuses livable, workable, and efficient. They are vital to the growth and sustainability of this community and are valued members of the community that they keep.
> 
> Our clerical workers, Facilities Management Staff, Custodians, Engineers, Dining Service Staff, Campus Services Staff, Carpenters, Electricians, and Plumbers that the university system employs are the backbone of our campus community. They are the individuals that make our scholarship possible, and they deserve respect from administrators at the top.
> 
> MPIRG objects to the decision made by University Administrators to employ the unfair labor practices of surface bargaining, regressive bargaining and refusing to negotiate on a mandatory subject of bargaining and believe it represent a schism in the amount of respect given to the administration’s pocketbook and the workers livelihoods. We cannot accept that an institution built off of our tuition payments and student debt conducts business in this manner.
> 
> MPIRG stands in solidarity with the university workers and agrees with worker leadership that there should not be a university split in two; One for the haves and another for the have-not’s. The creation of an exclusive system pay that only caters to the few is an unacceptable attack on the interests of the workers whose families rely on that work and paycheck.
> 
> As students that support the University of Minnesota system with our tuition and other monies, MPIRG and it’s membership demand that President Kaler and the rest of the university administration at our universities listen to the students that the University of Minnesota serves, and bargain in good faith with the workers that support that system.”
