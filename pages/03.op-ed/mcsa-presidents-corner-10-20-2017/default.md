Dear Campus Community,

Greetings! In the past few weeks, a lot has been going on around UMM. Michelle Behr was inaugurated as our Chancellor, we all probably conquered our midterms, organization events such as Coming Out Week and Indigenous Peopleâ€™s Day were successful, and we all grew internally with the passage of time.

Here is what has been happening in MCSA:

We hosted a Green Tour with our residential sustainability expert Troy Goodnough, and learned all sorts of things about how our campus works to reduce its footprint on the environment. 

The first-year class elected Sam Rosemark, Mitchell Scanlan, and Natalie Ogaro as their first-year representatives in MCSA. These three will also be serving as Campus Assembly Representatives.

MCSA forum passed a resolution on October 9 regarding the listserv, which I encourage you all to read below:

> Morris Campus Student Association Resolution Concerning the UMM Students Listserv 
> Authors: Josiah Gregg, Parker Smith
> 
> WHEREAS
> The University of Minnesota Morris (UMM) has long prided itself on its very involved student body, with more than 120 student organizations, and
> 
> WHEREAS
> The UMM Student Listserv served UMM for several years as a powerful mass communication tool before being deactivated in the fall of 2017, and
> 
> WHILE RECOGNIZING
> That student involvement in the Listserv has dropped over the past years, and language used on the Listserv was not always conducive to campus unity, the Listserv was still utilized by hundreds of students and promoted a diversity of thought, and 
> 
> WHEREAS 
> Communication is an essential part of fostering student involvement in activities that would otherwise not be considered, and
> 
> WHEREAS
> Campus Connections and the Campus Events Calendar are useful communication tools, they do not provide an adequate replacement for the Listserv, and
> 
> RECOGNIZING
> The necessity of a university moderated form of mass communication to adequately address the needs of students and faculty on a small campus, therefore
> 
> BE IT RESOLVED
> That the University of Minnesota Morris should be responsible for moderating an official mass
> communication tool that is suitable to the student body, and
> 
> BE IT RESOLVED
> The Morris Campus Student Association is prepared to work with the university to discover a suitable replacement.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, initiatives, or plans for world dominations that you would like to share with MCSA, please contact me or the closest MCSA member on hand and we will do our best to work on your behalf (or give you the tools you need to succeed).

Sincerely,

Elsie Wilson

MCSA President
