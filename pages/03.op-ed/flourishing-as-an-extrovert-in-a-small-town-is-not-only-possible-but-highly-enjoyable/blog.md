When my mom found out I was going to attend school in The Middle of Nowhere, Minnesota she told me that I would probably hate it because I’m an extrovert who needs to be around a lot of good and friendly people. I guess this was a concern of mine because I had never lived in a town so small and I had not visited Morris before coming here as a student. I could see through social media and the Morris website that there was plenty to do in town, but I was worried that some of that may have been exaggerated to draw in new students.

What I’ve learned from my three years of living here, though, is that a small town is the perfect place for an extrovert like me to flourish. To put it simply, in Morris I can approach someone in the grocery store and ask, unprompted, if they want to see a picture of my house/cat/cooking/any part of my daily life, to which they would probably be more than excited to chat. Back in Milwaukee where I came from, if I were to approach somebody in a grocery store and try to show them a picture totally unprompted, they may call the police — or maybe not — but at the very least, I’d get some weird stares. This is mostly a joke, but I have found it to be true in my day-to-day experiences. What I really mean to say is that there is a great community here in Morris and while the town is very small and I’m still getting used to that, all of the people here make up for it by being extremely welcoming.

I think that having a smaller town means that the concentration of good people in one space is a lot higher and I’m therefore more likely to run into somebody that I know or I’m excited to meet. I suppose I am glad that I didn’t end up at a bigger college in a larger city because I think it would be a lot harder to make friends if I’m not seeing the same people most days. I understand why my mom thought I might get stressed out being in a small place because overall there are fewer people, but like I said, having fewer people means that making connections is easier and more meaningful.

That said, there’s nothing wrong with big cities. There’s a lot to do in cities from museums and parks to cool restaurants and other attractions. Milwaukee is, in fact, a really neat city with plenty of stuff to do and all sorts of interesting people. The part of Milwaukee that I come from has a lot of coffee shops and tattoo artists and good music and street festivals that I love to be around. I do love Milwaukee, but I also don’t think I can picture myself staying in a big city for my entire life. I don’t already have a plan of where I’ll end up in life, but I think I should someday move to some different places to meet these different communities and share new experiences. This might just be through travel, but could also be changes in where I live.

I think the hardest thing about living in a city, at least for me, is that I wouldn’t get to see my friends as often as I would in a town that I can walk across easily. Maybe this is different than the experiences of others due to the fact that I don’t drive, but I think my point still stands. I’d prefer to end up in a town where my best friends live a block away, and I don’t think I’m crazy at all for having that priority. I’m lucky to have that living situation right now. I know that small towns might not be the perfect place for everyone and maybe there are some people here who are ready to finish school and move on to other places, and that’s totally fine. I think everybody should live in a place where they can feel a sense of community and where they can make friendships that last. Maybe I’ll stay in Morris for a while after I graduate and maybe I won’t, so it’s pretty likely that I will. All I know is that I’ve enjoyed getting the chance to feel like I belong somewhere because of the people around me.
