You’ve watched _House of Cards_ for its entire run. You’re a die-hard Kevin Spacey fan. You’ve got a friend group that binge watches the seasons. The ruthlessness, the sex, it’s all riveting. 

Come a few October days ago, you scroll through Twitter, and discover the recent sexual assault allegations against Spacey. The victims add up; Spacey is accused of 14 accounts of sexual assault. It’s horrible what Kevin Spacey did… should you still watch _House of Cards?_

A question like this holds many complexities. What do you do when your favorite actor is a known sexual abuser? This is no new issue. Alfred Hitchcock, Woody Allen, Casey Affleck, and most recently Harvey Weinstein are all Hollywood elites who have been accused of sexual assault. Should we condemn the work of these artists? Should we acknowledge that despicable people can create beautiful art? Can we watch a film without acknowledging the horrible acts an actor or producer has committed? Are we supporting an abuser by appreciating their art? 

I’ve never watched House of Cards, nor have I seen any of Louis C.K.’s work. But I know what it feels like to appreciate and admire an artist’s work. I wanted to explore the different opinions people hold when talking about predatory artists, thoroughly considering both sides of the argument. 

With some people, it is important to consider whether or not the artist’s morals and personality are reflected in the art. For instance, many works of abstract art may contain no moral value. David Carr, a professor of Ethics at Birmingham College, says that it’s easier to not judge the artist in this situation. However, a painting that depicts an artist’s beliefs and values, such as Picasso’s Spanish Civil War painting, _Guernica_, are easy targets of judgement. This can be applied in a _House of Cards_ scenario; are there morals presented in the plot line that reflect Spacey’s history or actions? Should that affect if you watch the show?

Other individuals believe that the complexity of this issue is too large. Peggy Drexler, psychology professor at Cornell University, says that if we looked into the private lives of every single artist we admire, we would find some disgusting and displeasing things. “It’s possible we’d never see a movie, look at a work of art or read a book again.” With this reasoning, many individuals think that it is acceptable to draw a fine line between the art and artist. 

“I think that you can definitely condemn the artist and still appreciate the art,” said Kayla Boultinghouse, senior at UMM. “I grew up on _The Cosby Show_ and I loved it...but the guy’s a creep.” 

Separating the art from the artist might also depend on the act committed. Someone may hold different levels of respect for an artist who robbed a store, than another who sexually assaulted a minor. Also, our personal experiences and values shape the way we see other people. Seeing Kevin Spacey correlate sexual assault with homosexuality offended many members of the LGBTQIA2S+ community. Spacey has lost their respect. 

Alternatively, many believe that making this distinction is no longer possible, and it lets the reader off the hook. Jessica Kiang writes that saying “separate the art and the artist” makes viewers feel “safe in the belief that the only moral quagmires they have to negotiate are the ones they bring into the theater with them.” 

Chrissy Kolaya, Assistant Professor of English at UMM, described to me how she looks at the debate. To her, while artists who are sexual predators can make interesting and important work, it’s also important to remember that there are lots of other artists doing so, too, who aren’t taking advantage of others. “There are plenty of talented people making good work while also managing to be decent people. I’d prefer to give my money and attention to these artists.” Kolaya notes that she has left writers who are known to be predators out of her syllabi on occasion.

People will continue to watch the work of artists who commit despicable crimes. When I asked students around campus if they’d continue viewing _House of Cards_, a strong majority of them said yes. Yet, when I asked why, they replied only by saying that it’s “a good show.” These revelations about sexual assault in Hollywood are opportunities for us to think critically about what we watch and the implications it has. Let’s challenge our campus to personally reflect on what we can do to keep predators out of the camera.
