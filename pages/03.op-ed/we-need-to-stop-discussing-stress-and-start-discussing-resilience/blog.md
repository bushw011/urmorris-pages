We’re nearly a month into the spring semester, and the stress of academic workloads is already starting to pile up for many students on campus. The beginning of a new semester — and the beginning of the seemingly insurmountable workload it will bring — has me thinking about how our society views stress, and how it often adds to one’s stress level rather than relieving it.

Stress is a normal part of life, but it doesn’t have to be an overwhelming one. Often, we discuss the ability to cope with stress as an innate skill, saying things like, “She just doesn’t handle stress well” and “Some people can handle stress better than others” and while this can be true, it doesn’t mean it can’t be changed.

Recently, I learned about a tool in psychology called the Resilience Model. Basically, it outlines different aspects of our lives (biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural) and how each of these areas contributes to our resilience, or our ability to bounce back from stressful, challenging situations. Being aware of the ideas behind the model could not only help a person coping with a stressful situation to recognize areas of their life that they could improve upon or utilize to help them, but also help someone trying to act as a source of support to recognize things they could do to better support someone struggling to cope with stress. Some parts of the model may seem like common sense: if someone doesn’t have a reliable support network, have low self-worth, and/or live in an environment where they feel unhappy, they likely won’t be able to cope with stress as well as someone who has a network of support to help alleviate the stress, believes in their own ability to overcome challenges, and/or lives in an environment where they feel they belong. But the Resilience Model goes deeper than that. It hypothesizes that ameliorating these areas of life will improve one’s resilience, or make it easier for them to cope with stress.

Again, that may seem like common sense. But the thing is, we don’t usually talk about stress this way in America. Even though I believe that people can improve their mental health by improving aspects of their lives, I never thought about one’s ability to cope with stress as flexible because I am accustomed to thinking of resilience as a partially innate quality. Even when we discuss stress management as a concept able to be changed and improved upon, we do so in a somewhat daunting light. We create stress management classes, time management classes, and wellness workshops, as if self-care is a complicated concept which requires assistance in navigating.

Although there is certainly a benefit to classes such as these, the very fact that we treat self-care as something to be studied once stress already exists perpetuates this idea that stress will always start out with the upper hand, and that tackling it requires some secret knowledge only successful people have. It would be more helpful to teach people that although stress is inevitable, there are simple things in their lives that can alleviate it, things like social support networks and a healthy sleep schedule that either already exist and need to be recognized, or that are shortly within grasp. If we were to talk about stress in a way that gave people agency over their own stress management, it could help us to be more hopeful about our abilities to deal with stressful situations. Obviously, everyone deals with stress in different ways and simply becoming aware of one psychological model isn’t going to magically alleviate stress for everyone who studies it, but discussing stress in a way that emphasizes one’s ability to better their resilience may be a good start to decreasing stress’ power over us.
