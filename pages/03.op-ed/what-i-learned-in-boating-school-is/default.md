Last week Wednesday, _The University Register_ held elections for next year’s editorial board. For the first time since I’ve been with the newspaper, we left our elections night with all positions for next year covered, and, for the first time since I’ve been with the newspaper, I didn’t walk away with a position. This was according to plan. What _didn’t_ go according to plan was me crying like a little bitch later that evening upon realizing that, for the first time since I’ve been with the newspaper, _I will no longer be_ with the newspaper.

As anyone who’s visited the UR office on a layout night knows, they’re more than a little hectic. By which I mean our layout nights are, conservatively, fucking bonkers. They’re twelve-hour hazes of stuttering computer screens, whirlwinds of people weaving in and out of the foreground as they embark and return from personal missions completely and utterly lost on me as I focus on completing my own, and, if one listens closely enough, strange, abstract phrases such as “what’s so baltic about a bedpan?” can be heard just over whatever music happens to be playing at the time, be it the Harry Potter soundtrack, “Terryfold” by Chaos Chaos, or Jon Antonsen’s current favorite trap music. Liberally, it is a swirling iridescent pool of entropic nonsense that seems ready to collapse inward on itself at any given moment, least of all because even just the pitter-patter of a toddler’s footsteps in the hall above our office gives the impression that the ceiling is a feather touch away from caving in.

And so, “why,” you’re likely asking yourself, “why would Christian be sad about leaving something that sounds so chaotic and unenjoyable?” The answer is that working for Morris’ premier campus newspaper is chaotic, but very enjoyable. Actually, it is a freaking blast, and here’s why: not only am I creating and sharing my art with others on a biweekly basis, following a near-60-year-old line of UR editor-in-chiefs before me, I am surrounded by some of UMM’s brightest, most dedicated, and by far most supportive students while I do it. 

Where my dorm is my home away from home, the UR office is my home away from home away from home, and the UR staff is my second family. I love each and every one of my coworkers and I am so incredibly grateful to have had the privilege to spend the last three years of my life working, learning, and growing alongside them. I’ve made lifelong friends who are the very definition of “amazing,” “the bee’s knees,” and “the créme de la créme.” And that’s not all.

See, I’ve also had the incredible joy of readers telling me how much they appreciate my opinion editorials, even (and sometimes especially) if the opinion I expressed is an unpopular one. I’ve had students request personalized horoscopes because “they’re the only thing [they] read,” and I’ve had faculty members I'd never met before—one of whom I later learned had an MFA in creative writing!—tell me they enjoyed reading my pieces. When so often it feels like I only have two consistent readers (thanks, Mom and Dad), I thank my lucky stars over and over again for everyone who picks up an issue of _The UR_, even if it’s just to solve the Sudoku puzzle on page 11.

It is for those reasons—and about one hundred other smaller ones that I have neither the time nor room to go into here—that I am thoroughly saddened to be leaving _The University Register._ It is with an overwhelmingly heavy heart, some of which might be on the Old No. 1 food I ate last night, that I write the last sentence of my last master editorial for _The UR_. It is thus: please enjoy what I am positive will be one of our best years yet.

Thanks for reading,

Christian Pfeiffer,
