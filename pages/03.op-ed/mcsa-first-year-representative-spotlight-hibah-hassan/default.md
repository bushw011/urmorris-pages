**Hibah Hassan, elected Freshman Representative to the MCSA council, is working hard to represent the freshman class well. From Prior Lake MN, Hassan is a Biology major on the Pre-Med track. She has always had an interest in medicine, and she hopes to be a Cardiothoracic surgeon. Other than MCSA, Hassan also holds her own radio show at 6 p.m. on Wednesdays, and she is an important part of the Mock Trial team. I sat down with her to talk about her position as First Year Rep.**

**Describe yourself in three words.**
> Passionate, creative, and caring.

**Describe the position you hold and any responsibilities or tasks you may have.**
> As first year rep, I work with my fellow reps to gage first year interest, not only in activities just in the school in general. Not just, “hey I feel like there is a lack in events” but “I didn’t like orientation.” Our job is to take these problems and come up with solutions and address them at the MCSA forum. 

**What made you interested in the position?**
> I was president of the 12th grade house in my school. I served on Senate, I was secretary, and vice president. Working with students trying to make their general existence at school better is something I’ve always enjoyed. Since I’m a freshman at Morris, it’s something I can do to engage in the community. 

**What are your objectives or goals as first year rep? Is there anything you are not satisfied with at UMM that you want to change?**
> Personally, I would like to work on trying to get first years being more involved in activities and more invested in the community. One thing I’m guilty of is that I like to go home a lot. I really like going home on weekends and spending time with my family, and I know a lot of first years like to do that. While I think that it is great, it would be good for us to work on building a sense of community and kinship between the other first years and the campus as a whole. 

**How would you carry out this goal?**
> For example, we just had that first year survey a week or two ago. Conducting more surveys and having more first year activities planned, specifically with the intent of doing things first years are interested in. Stuff around town is really important too. 

**Who are some people who have influenced or shapes who you are today?**
> I’m gonna credit my best friend Harshida. In a lot of ways she has shaped me to the person I am today. Before I met her, I was definitely more reserved and a little more hesitant to step out of my bubble. She has made me become the social person I am. Also my mom has shaped me. As an educator, she has a degree in psychology. She’s worked hard to raise me and my sisters with my dad. She’s a very strong and smart woman. She values education and community building. She’s really probably one of the coolest people I know. 

**What would you like to say to your fellow first years?** 
> I would say don’t hesitate to talk about what’s bothering you. Don’t be afraid to come forward and share your problems with first year reps or the MCSA. Let us know, and we will do everything we can to help you. 

**A lover of acting, music, and theater, Hassan is working hard to get involved on the Morris campus. Besides representing the freshman class, you can catch Hassan at open-mic night, strumming her ukelele and singing a tune.**
