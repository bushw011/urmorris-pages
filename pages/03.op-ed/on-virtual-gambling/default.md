Hearthstone. Fire Emblem: Heroes. Fate: Grand Order. Pokemon Masters. Grand Summoners. Candy Crush Saga. These are all cell phone games available on Android and iOS app stores. They are all incredibly fun, flashy, and perhaps the worst thing possible: addictive. You may have heard the term loot box--sometimes also called “gacha”--thrown around lately in the news. These games all feature some sort of loot box or microtransaction system, designed to drain all of the hard earned (or even not-so-hard earned) cash from everyone who plays. Who’s the primary target?

Everyone.

I typically tend to err on the side of the gaming community on issues--representation, independent developers, and unique experiments among them--however the virtual gambling that’s become omnipresent in the mobile gaming sphere has become a problem for everyone.

These microtransactions entice unsuspecting users to spend money on speed-ups, skips, and premium currency for another chance to spin the digital slot machine. Sometimes it’s characters from a popular franchise for your party, other times it’s weapons andskills that your character couldn’t normally get, and others it’s just a JPEG of a character that influences nothing but your status. All of these for the low entry fee of a dollar, and for the high rollers upwards of $100. These games don’t just bring in a few dollars here and there to keep the lights on. As much as we all wish they did, these games bring in the big money. Pokemon Masters, the newest
game from DeNA and Nintendo, in its first week of release (August 29, 2019) made $25 million USD. Surprising? This is just half of what Nintendo and Niantic’s other Pokemon game, Pokemon GO, made in its first week. They continue to make more and more, and nobody is really safe.

You often hear about “F2P”-ers, or ‘Free-to-Play’ players, who don’t spend a single dime and make it well into the game. And that’s fine, there’s nothing wrong with that, though some may argue that they’re not getting the “true experience” of paying to win. Games like Hearthstone, which are comparable to real life TCGs like Magic: The Gathering, are only played at the highest level by people who shell out massive amounts of money each season to pull the best cards. Unlike Magic, where you can play in old seasons for fun or sell your cards to make a return on investment, in Hearthstone your purchases are permanent. There is no value; they’re pixels on the screen.

Ultimately I’m ranting here about gacha and microtransaction culture, but it’s because I used to be one of those big spenders. I used to spend anywhere from $1
to $30 a week, every week, on Final Fantasy: Record Keeper, a popular mobile game inspired by the Final Fantasy franchise. I cut the cord after I realized all my money could better be spent elsewhere. My peers, who may or may not have a disposable income like I might have, are equally at risk. It is your money, after all. You spend it how you want. But think about how that money could be spent elsewhere.
