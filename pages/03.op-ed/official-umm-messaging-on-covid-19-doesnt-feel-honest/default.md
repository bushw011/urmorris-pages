When the University of Minnesota surprised us with the announcement that in-person classes would resume this fall, I was cautiously optimistic. I figured that our university, with its resources and knowledge, might serve as a microcosm of a society more prepared for this pandemic than the outside world and that perhaps we’d see random testing and aggressive contact tracing.

But the question of how things would play out on the Morris campus kept hanging, and hanging, and hanging until late July when it was announced via FAQ that these things were “impossible” and that these aspects of battling COVID-19 would be entrusted to the surrounding area.

And hey, maybe. While it’s certainly disappointing that we’re not seeing, say, random testing of students to monitor how we’re doing, I have no concrete reason to believe that UMM administration is any less disappointed than I am about this limitation, so I’m willing to afford them some benefit of the doubt.

That said, this past Friday my patience was certainly tested. Here’s a selection from Chancellor Michelle Behr’s email to the UMMOFFICIAL list:

“Because classrooms have been measured and reconfigured to ensure that students are six feet away from each other and from the instructor, merely being in a class with someone who has tested positive does not constitute exposure. Facilities Management has arranged classroom seating based on MDH advice and guidance: if furniture is left as configured, it will ensure that even if there is a person in a class who has the virus, other class members and instructors should not be exposed.”

There’s certainly a lot to unpack in the implicit news—and if my inference is wrong, I’d to love hear that—that contact tracing will not inform classmates of a confirmed case of COVID-19, such a far cry from the aggressive fight against this virus I hoped my university would take on. What’s more alarming is Behr’s absolute language about how impossible it is that UMM’s in-person classes might spread the virus. “It will ensure” is fairly absolute language for a virus that we’re still figuring out. Behr’s language contrasts wildly with public health officials who advocate fiercely for preventative measures while also respecting us enough to let us know they’re not 100% failsafe.

The recent Duke University study that compares the efficacy of various types of masks (if you typically use a bandana or especially a neck fleece, you should probably read the study) still showed at least 5% of droplet transmission when using almost any mask compared to the control case (the exception is a fitted N95 mask, which came in at a whopping .1%). Don’t get me wrong, a 90-95% reduction in droplet transmission is great, but every interaction you have is still a small risk. It’s just a matter of playing probabilities.

A recent British Medical Journal article titled, “Two metres or one: what is the evidence for physical distancing in covid-19?” warns against “oversimplification” of distancing rules. Its authors emphasize that “nothing’s zero risk,” per NBC. Along with masks, distance, time spent, and levels of occupancy as factors, the article invites people to think about ventilation, an important factor students should take into consideration when deciding if they want to go to class or stick it out on Zoom, or whether they want to eat a meal in the Dining Hall (deep cleaning is all well and good, but it does not significantly address the major vectors of COVID spread). 
One might also wonder why UMM also hasn’t tried to move as many things as possible outdoors while we still can.

I’ve been rather puzzled why Michelle Behr’s communications with students don’t have this room for nuance. We’re the University of Minnesota. In a country so socially unprepared for the challenges of a pandemic, I’d expect that we’d be a beacon of caution. But every day I see a new horror story about students returning to Universities: from Notre Dame, to the University of Alabama, to the University of Iowa, to the University of Michigan. Many students believe that they are being set up to fail, and I’m inclined to agree. Seeing this email, my suspicion is that in case of an outbreak, the University is preparing to blame the students, claiming it couldn’t possibly be the fault of the people who invited them back into this small town. That might sound cynical, but it’s hard not to be when it feels the University’s official communications aren’t being honest with us.
