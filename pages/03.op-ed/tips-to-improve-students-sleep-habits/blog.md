With the recent time change, I’ve been thinking about sleep deprivation. Our brains need a certain amount of sleep to function properly — depending on who you ask, college students need seven or eight hours of sleep per night, but with everything going on in our schedules, that quota can be hard to meet. I’m not going to demand that every student who reads this rearrange their lives to ensure they get eight hours of sleep per night because I know how difficult that can be, but I thought I’d take this opportunity to suggest some tips for students looking to improve their sleep habits.

First, consider turning on (or downloading, if your device doesn’t already have one) a blue light filter for your cell phone and laptop. Blue light may seem harmless, but it disrupts your brain’s ability to produce melatonin, which aids our ability to sleep. Melatonin responds to darkness, and any light will disrupt its production (about 
twenty minutes of exposure to dusk-level light will inhibit your melatonin production) but blue light is especially disruptive. Setting a bluelight filter on your phone and/or computer to turn on at least an hour before you typically go to sleep will aid your melatonin production and help to improve your sleep habits. Ideally, it is not recommended to use electronics for at least an hour before bed, but with the amount of our assignments that are online, that would be very difficult for most students to do.

Another method to improve sleep habits is to pay attention to what time you’re consuming caffeine. Caffeine works by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain. Adenosine is a neurotransmitter which builds up throughout the day and, once its levels are high enough, results in the feeling of sleepiness. When we sleep, our adenosine levels decrease and the cycle starts over again when we wake up. When caffeine blocks adenosine from binding to their receptors in the brain, it prevents us from being able to feel tired until they leave the receptors and allow adenosine to bind. However, since adenosine builds up throughout the day, it’s more effective to consume caffeine in the late morning. That way, it can block the receptors before too much adenosine has a chance to bind, and it will also leave the receptors by
the evening, allowing your brain to fall back into its regular patterns by the time you need to fall asleep. Caffeine has a half-life of approximately six hours, so if you drink a cup of coffee at 10 am, half of the caffeine in that coffee will still be bound to your adenosine receptors at 4 pm. Also, even if you typically don’t have trouble falling asleep after drinking caffeine in the evening, the caffeine will likely still push back your circadian rhythms, so you will naturally fall asleep about half and hour later than you would naturally do otherwise, even if the act of falling asleep doesn’t feel any more difficult than usual. Keeping this in mind, be aware of what time you’re consuming caffeine to better help your sleep.

One of the more difficult ways you can improve your sleep habits is to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, even on the weekends. This seems like a simple enough goal, but with packed schedules and rapidly approaching deadlines, this can be one of the hardest sleep habits for college students to get the hang of. When people don’t get enough sleep, they accumulate sleep debt and in order to make up for it, they need to catch up on the sleep they’ve lost. On the weekends, when students tend to stay up later than they would on a weekday, they can actually produce an effect similar to jet lag for themselves. So, although it may be difficult, try to keep your sleep schedule consistent. It will make both falling asleep and waking up easier. There are many other methods to improve sleep habits, but these three are some of the most prominent in sleep research. If you think you may have a sleep disorder such as insomnia, consider stopping by the Wellness Center and asking what you can do to improve your sleep habits. Sleep is an ordinary part of life, and though it can be easily overlooked in our work-centered society, it is vital that we prioritize a healthy sleep routine as part of our general self care. As always, I encourage you all to be aware of your physical and mental health and prioritize what is best for you.
