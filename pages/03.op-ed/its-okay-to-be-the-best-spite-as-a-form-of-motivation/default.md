It is now getting to that point in the semester when we all collectively realize that exams, winter break, and even the start of the second semester are all much closer than expected. This is consequently the point in the semester where it becomes harder and harder to stay motivated when it comes to classes, work, and other responsibilities throughout the day. If you’re someone like me, you’ve had days where it became all too tempting to just stay in bed. You also might be someone who gets a little sick of the usual advice; even though you and I know that proper diet and sleep and all of that stuff is important, we might still need more factors on top of that all working in our favor. 

In the past, I personally have found that I do best when I have a bit of competition. Competition is not inherently a bad thing, and can be extremely helpful. It’s totally valid to use spite or trying to be better than other people as motivation, but only if you are not trying to drag others down in the process. The most important thing to remember is that there is a huge difference between wanting to be better than others and wanting others to fail. While you do not want to have an ego that hurts others, it doesn’t hurt to have confidence. 

For me, one example of having something to prove and finding motivation has been with music. I don’t want to go into music, nor do I think I’m the best at what I do. I do know, however, that a lot of people consider the oboe to be a weird or less-desirable instrument. (Go ahead and laugh at me, I’m essentially playing the duck-pipe.) I know that a well-played oboe can sound beautiful and elegant, but I also know that I was on the receiving end of many jokes about that instrument back in middle school or early high school. I get it, starting off with a less popular instrument might not make you the coolest kid in sixth grade, but I wasn’t going to let that stop me from really enjoying all of my time in band and full orchestra. I still play oboe today, possibly originally to prove a point or to show that the oboe can be kinda neat sometimes, but I do truly enjoy it now!

This is just one example, and it may not apply to everyone, but I get the feeling that most people have done something just to prove something to others. Is that a problem? Not if nobody is getting hurt. You can apply this to everyday life, fueling yourself, with spite, to be a more successful person. This does not just have to be directed towards others, however, and is equally effective towards yourself. When that whiny voice in the back of your head tells you that it would be easier to sleep or watch your favorite show instead of being productive or that there’s no point in trying, prove that asshole wrong! In fact, you can be extra productive just to prove how rad you are!

In the end, do what you need to do to be successful as long as you aren’t causing others to fail. My ramblings might not connect with everyone’s individual experience, but I want people to know that it’s not bad to want success for yourself and that spite is a valid form of motivation. Even when you are tired and struggle to get started on what you need to do, get up and keep going in order to be the best you that you can be. You’ve got this!
