**By Christian Pfeiffer, Editor-in-Chief** _uploaded at 8:42 p.m. on Thursday, February 22, 2018_ 

So, if memory serves, it was around this time last year that I published one of my favorite op-eds I’ve ever written to date. Looking at it from an anniversary/throwback perspective, it seemed like a good time to reprint it. Also, I’m one of those people who will unapologetically reblog a post that didn’t get enough likes the first time around. So, without further ado, I hope you read, and I hope you enjoy “A Word From the Editor-in-Chief,” originally published last year.
