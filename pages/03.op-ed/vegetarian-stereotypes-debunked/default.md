title: 'Vegetarian Stereotypes Debunked'

**By Tehya Wachuta, Editor-in-Chief**

**MYTH:** Vegetarians don’t get enough protein. 

**TRUTH:** Meat is not the only source of protein, although it is a common one. Vegetarians can obtain protein from foods such as peanut butter, beans, cheese, yogurt, and soy products. Also, one’s body already produces protein naturally, so a large amount of daily protein consumption isn’t entirely necessary for human survival.

**MYTH:** Vegetarians are pretentious and if you eat meat in front of them, they will shun you for eternity.

**TRUTH:** First of all, anyone can be pretentious. Also, many vegetarians won’t be grossed out if someone eats meat in front of them, but don’t force them to share an omnivorous meal. Shoving meat in a vegetarian’s face is blatantly rude and disrespectful. Don’t do it. 

**MYTH:** Vegetarians can’t be serious athletes.

**TRUTH:** Some people think that because vegetarians don’t get enough protein - which is another myth in itself - they can’t exercise excessively without becoming easily fatigued. However, this isn’t necessarily the case. Former boxer Mike Tyson was a vegan, and made it into the International Boxing Hall of Fame the same year he made this diet change.

**MYTH:** Vegetarians only eat vegetables.

**TRUTH:** This is, obviously, not true. Despite the “veggie” prefix, vegetarians eat from all five food groups and, if one tries, maintain a healthy and balanced diet. Vegetarians also tend to have a more varied and global diet.
 
 **MYTH:** Vegetarians can easily stay skinny and healthy.

**TRUTH:** Junk food is, for the most part, vegetarian, and it is easy for anyone, no matter their diet, to eat unhealthily.

**MYTH:** Vegetarians are “missing out”.

**TRUTH:** Vegetarians make the conscious choice to omit meat with every meal they eat, and if they thought they were “missing out,” they could simply pick up a hamburger and try a bite. There are soy-based meat supplements which have a similar taste and texture to meat, although not all vegetarians choose to eat them. Instead of making assumptions, flip the tables: Maybe you’re “missing out” on the vegetarian lifestyle.
