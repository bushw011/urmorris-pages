“For the third year in a row, enrollment at UMMwarts has decreased substantially,” UMMwarts Admissions Counselor Andrei Krayevsky wrote _The Daily Register_ earlier this week, in response to an inquiry made by one of the Register’s reporters. “At this rate, the school is going to be forced to make some tough budget cuts, and it’s looking likelier and likelier that these cuts could mean layoffs for campus staff,” Brumgeon continued in his letter, speaking of UMMwarts’ immediate need to boost attendance. “It is imperative that we identify the causes of our diminishing enrollment sooner rather than later because, simply put, fewer students means less money for the university, its employees, and its students.”

As of yet, however, the reasons behind the drop in UMMwarts’ attendance have yet to be identified.

Said one member of the school’s Board of Regents who wished to remain anonymous, “We really have no clue as to why enrollment at UMMwarts has been decreasing. We’ve considered a number of possible causes, but each one just doesn’t seem wholly convincing.” Indeed, the same source reported, campus administrators have looked into a variety of potential contributing factors, such as “the campus’s removed location from urban areas, its limited handicap accessibility for witches and wizards with physical disabilities, its harsh wind and frigid winters, its outdated and crumbling infrastructure, its rampant wi-fi connectivity issues, its months-long turnaround time on simple dorm appliance repairs, Goblexo’s questionable treatment of Dining Hall house-elves, its Division III Quidditch team ranking, its borderline-inhumane summer living conditions, its disorganized Orifice of Wizarding Life, its Convenience Shoppe’s price gouged merchandise, and even the administration’s lack of transparency with students and staff,” but “none of them seem to be a problem of any real note.”

When asked whether UMMwarts’ small but active Junior Death Eater Party might be one plausible reason why prospective students are opting out of attending UMMwarts, Headmistress Megaera Behrus was reported to have responded with “What? Who are they?” and “Oh, you guys just need to learn to get along.”

As spring semester begins to draw to a close, identifying the root of UMMwarts’ enrollment problem becomes more urgent if the school is to remain financially successful, which is why one member of the Orifice of Wizarding Life has been working feverishly on fixing an UMMwarts’ problem that has “irked him for awhile now.” By this, Deputy Orifice Manager Raidne Sponde is referring to UMMwarts’ never having rented a laser tag system before.

In a Tuesday interview, Sponde reported to _Register_ staff, “I don’t think we’ll find the cause of our decreasing enrollment anytime soon, so rather than wasting time playing guessing games, I really think we should focus our efforts on improving what we know we can improve. For me, that’s our lack of laser tag. Did you know UMMwarts has never rented a laser tag system? I was horrified when I found out, and I say remedying this needs to be a top priority.”

When asked whether he believed there were any other “top priorities” UMMwarts was in need of fixing, Sponde did reply that he felt _The Daily Register_ was in need of having more oversight. “If you ask me, [the _Register_] needs to have some sort of staff or faculty advisor to keep [it] in line; I’m sick of [it] allowing people to publish anonymous opinion editorials that criticize our university and make [UMMwarts] look bad.”
