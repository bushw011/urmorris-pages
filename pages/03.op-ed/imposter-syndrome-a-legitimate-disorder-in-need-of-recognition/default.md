Those of you who read my last editorial, you may remember that I referenced the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Last issue, I was focused on the reasons why the DSM may cause problems with our societal expectations regarding people with mental health disorders. This got me thinking: what about disorders not included in the DSM? Are the people with them less susceptible to stigma, or would their experience be less stressful if their disorder was covered in the DSM, given that it would be more likely for disorders in the book to be researched? One disorder not in the DSM I have been thinking a lot about recently is Imposter Syndrome.

Imposter Syndrome is the feeling that you are not truly as intelligent or capable as people say you are. Despite all of your accomplishments, you feel you don’t deserve them and that someone is going to discover how incompetant you really are at any given moment. I have not researched this disorder extensively, so I encourage anyone who is interested in learning more about it to look it up themselves. 

Dr. Pauline Clance of Georgia State University ran studies on people with Imposter Syndrome and created a scale to determine how strongly a person’s self-perception fits with the symptoms of Imposter Syndrome. Dr. Valerie Young, another expert on the syndrome, categorized the disorder into five different types. When I discovered the concept of Imposter Syndrome, it helped bring clarity to my mindset about myself and my accomplishments, which is why, in this editorial, I would like to outline the five types of Imposter Syndrome in hopes of helping someone else think differently about their own self-perception.

Type 1: The Perfectionist. People with this type of Imposter Syndrome have a difficult time believing that they are successful or have done enough because they believe that they could always do better. They also react with major self-doubt when they cannot achieve a goal (or feel they fell short of one) because they hold themselves to such high standards.

Type 2: The Superhero. People with this type of Imposter Syndrome are especially concerned with the idea that everyone else in their classes/work/peer group is actually intelligent and capable, while they are just pretending. These people tend to overwork themselves to try to prove their worth and are constantly hoping for validation to prove that they are doing the right thing.

Type 3: The Natural Genius. This type of Imposter Syndrome is similar to the Perfectionist type in that people with it will hold themselves to impossibly high standards. However, they also believe that they should naturally have the skills others expect of them, so they are overwhelmed with self-doubt when they cannot master something right away. To them, not being able to instantly understand or develop skill in a certain field proves that they are not as intelligent as their peers believe them to be.

Type 4: The Soloist. People with this type of Imposter Syndrome are especially concerned with other people discovering that they are not as intelligent or capable as they are believed to be. They view asking for help as a sign of weakness and as a threat to their charade — if other people know they need help, they’ll know they aren’t as skilled as they pretend to be. These people often feel pressured to learn and accomplish things on their own in order to prove their worth.

Type 5: The Expert. People with this type of Imposter Syndrome believe that in order to be intelligent, they have to master everything. For this reason, they never believe they are qualified enough to hold certain jobs or call themselves skilled at something. They will experience self-doubt when reminded of the things they have yet to learn.

All of these types of Imposter Syndrome are examples of maladaptive mindsets. To overcome them, one would need to adopt a more healthy mindset and self-perception. Personally, I think the best way to do this would be to participate in cognitive-behavioral therapy and work with a trained mental health professional to identify unhealthy, unrealistic beliefs and learn healthier ways of thinking.

All this said, I do not know the answer to my opening question: How does the absence of Imposter Syndrome in the DSM affect those who have it? I can theorize a few things, though. I worry that people may be less willing to recognize a mental health disorder as legitimate if it is not included in the DSM, which would be detrimental to those with Imposter Syndrome since it would open up stigma regarding their disorder and may prevent them from learning about it. Although I cannot exactly fix this potential problem with one editorial, I hope that I have been able to shed light on this disorder for anyone who may benefit from learning of it.
