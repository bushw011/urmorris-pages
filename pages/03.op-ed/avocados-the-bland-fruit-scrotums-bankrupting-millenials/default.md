Time for all y’all liberal, millennial snowflakes to get #triggered, ‘cause you’re about to hear why avocados are terrible. Please take a moment to put on your running crocs and find your designated safe space.

The avocado is one ugly-ass motherfucker. It looks like The Incredible Hulk’s scrotum, tanned dark by an ozone layer-deprived Los Angeles sun. And that’s on a good day? Have you seen those li’l shits when they’re “ripe?” Yum-ee. Because when you think of good food, you think of mushy, black ovoids with warts. Then you open the sucker up to find a happy little choking hazard, hand-crafted by the Amish, surrounded by mucous-colored water-meat with a texture inspired by stale Jell-O. And to top it all off, the inside is called “flesh.” It’s a no for me.

Then there’s the taste. If you’ve never tried an avocado, do yourself a favor and continue to never try an avocado. If you have, our support group meets on Saturdays at 11:00 a.m., bring your own coffee. Now, I’m aware that this cautionary statement won’t be good enough for the inquisitive reader who has never had their life ruined by avocados, so let me attempt to describe what Bruce Banner’s banana basement tastes like so you don’t have to experience it for yourself:






































There. Moving on, there’s also the issue of how expensive these green wax turds are. According to Australian multimillionaire, Tim Gurner, millennials are spending nineteen dollars a day on getting their avocado toast fix, avocado toast being, I’m sure, street slang for some sort of avocado-based, hallucinogenic drug. This, he continues, is why millennials are struggling to afford homes! I honestly don’t know what’s more disgusting: the fact that these tasteless, seaweed-green fruit-lumps from God’s “reject” pile are bankrupting thousands of millennials yearly, OR that the public seems to be okay with it! Sure, ban guns, abortions, everyone of the Muslim faith, but meanwhile, no one seems concerned that my little sister is at risk of forming a chemical dependency on a “super-food” available at almost every grocery store in the area.

Last but not least, did you know that many avocados are grown and raised in southern California? Now I’m not a racist, but you can find _a lot_ of bad _hombres_ down there in that part of the country. Is this really the best place to look for wholesome foods? I’m not so sure. 

If you really think about it, it’s actually entirely possible that some of these Southern Californian avocados could have illegally slipped over the border from Mexico, perhaps acting as drug mules for wild finches, anything for a shot at our job market. Therefore, I ask you, is this really some sort of god-fruit you want to put in your body? I can guarantee you these finches aren’t sending their best, or these avocados wouldn’t be hiding balloons filled with cocaine up their calyxes. It’s just simple logic. You can’t trust an avocado.
