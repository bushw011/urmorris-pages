I know that since it’s the third week of classes, it may be a little late to welcome freshmen to campus, but punctuality has never exactly been my strong suit. So, welcome, freshmen! I hope your first few weeks on campus have been phenomenal, and the transition into life on campus has been stressless. 

During orientation, you probably heard all about all of the academic and extracurricular opportunities UMM has to offer, from the writing center and PAL to the plethora of clubs and organizations here on campus. But don’t forget, there are plenty of things to do off campus as well.

While the warm weather lasts, you could go to the numerous parks in Morris, take a walk along the Pomme de Terre river, or explore the Horticulture Display Garden. If you’re looking for something to do in town, you could go to the skate park or visit the bowling alley. And if you like movies, UMM students can purchase discounted tickets in the Student Center at the Information Desk (right next to Higbies). If you enjoy shopping, there are several shops downtown as well.

If you’re looking for places to eat in town, there are plenty of restaurants. I highly recommend getting a milkshake from Don’s Cafe. If you’re looking for a place to get coffee and relax, try going to Common Cup. And if you’re looking for somewhere to buy your own food, try going to Meadowland Market — you’ll save a lot of money that way.

Now, that doesn’t encompass everything there is to do in Morris, but I hope that something on that list sparked your interest. As many things as this campus has to offer, it can be nice to have other places to go as well. And if you’re like me and don’t have a car, it’s good to know that there are plenty of places within walking distance of campus. 

When I first came to Morris last year, I was afraid that it would be difficult to learn how to balance my academic responsibilities with all the activities available both on and off campus. But don’t worry, you’ll learn to establish a schedule that works for you, and I’ve found that it isn’t as difficult as I was afraid it was going to be. But if you think you might need help structuring your schedule, there are plenty of people on campus who can help you, including your friends, your CA, and the student counselors on campus. 

If you feel overwhelmed, just take a step back and take a mental health break. Whether you just need to do something simple to relax, like listening to music or hanging out with friends, or if a visit to the student counselors would be more helpful, figure out what works for you. Sometimes it’s easy to forget that the brain is an organ just like the heart or the lungs, but it’s just as important to take care of as any other organ is. And even though stress may not always be detrimental, it’s a good idea to do whatever works for you to keep it to a minimum.

The other thing I was afraid of when I moved to Morris was being so far from home. That may not be a concern for everyone, but my hometown is eight hours away and I had never been on my own before. Luckily, my CA and the people on my floor did a fantastic job of making Morris feel like home and providing me with a great support network. If you’re worried about the same thing I was, the people on your floor and the friends you make elsewhere on campus can be a great help.

I hope that all of you have as phenomenal of a freshman year as I did, and that you’re able to find a way to make Morris feel like your home.

Until next issue,
