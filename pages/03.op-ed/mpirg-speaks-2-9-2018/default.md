Hello Campus!

Welcome back from winter break! Hope it was everything that it needed to be for you and got you prepared for a full and wonderful semester of activities and activism. MPIRG has already been hard at work this semester creating some solid events that benefit everyone on our campus as well as getting prepared for our future campaigns. We officially began our Spring semester last week on Wednesday with our Spring Semester Kickoff. We had a wonderful time connecting with some new folks and talking with new folks as well as past longtime members about ways that we can achieve our current goals. We also talked about how we can expand on our current campaigns to continue our work making change in our community.

We have also already kicked off one of our main campaigns for this semester. Our Fair Student Housing Campaign is already in full swing! This campaign is centered around giving students, including ourselves, an equal voice in housing situations where there is typically a property owner in a position of power. We believe that discussing common problems student to student and educating ourselves about what our options and rights are as tenants are the key ways to empower ourselves with the knowledge to make us taken as equal when talking with property owners. With this campaign, we want to give all students every resource they desire to make this a reality. To kick this campaign off, we had our Housing Student Forum last week on Tuesday. This event culminated in an engaging and thoughtful discussion and assessment of the state of student housing in Morris. Armed with the knowledge we gained at that event, we have gained even more drive to make this campaign the best it can be so we can make a substantial difference on this front. We will periodically be sharing these discussion points on our campaign Facebook page. Visit and like ‘Morris Fair Student Housing Campaign’ on Facebook to hear about those conversations and stay up to date on our future campaign activities! We are also proud to say that our campaign has been endorsed by MCSA! We are very much looking forward to that partnership and welcome any other organization, group, or office that would like to contribute.

Our next event in this campaign is titled ‘Renting as a Student: Student Housing Workshop.’ This is a big informational and educational event that is designed to be a crash course in the finer points of rental law, renters rights, best practices for tenants, and more. We are trying to keep this event as interactive and engaging as possible, so come out and learn a thing or two! If you are someone who has a pretty good knowledge of any of these topics, come and help educate your fellow students! The workshop is on Saturday, February 24 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. We will be providing a light lunch for everyone who comes. Come out to learn and support your fellow students!

As always, if you want to get involved in anything that we are doing, or if you would like to talk about taking on a new issue, come to our meetings! Everyone is always welcome. We meet every Wednesday at 7:00 p.m. in the Moccasin Flower room, just off of Louie’s. See you there!
