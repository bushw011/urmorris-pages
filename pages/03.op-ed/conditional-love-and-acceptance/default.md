Have you ever struggled to “understand” queer people? Well, here’s a simple trick to get you started: stop trying to.

Think about it this way: do you rationalize why you’re attracted to the people you find sexy? For
example: let’s say you see someone walking down the street who you think is H-A-W-T. You can probably identify which of their features you find attractive, but you probably don’t sit and rationalize why you find these features attractive. In other words, you’re not looking at dat ass and thinking to yourself, _wowza, now that’s a butt that could smuggle enough cocaine across the border to pay off my debt to Frank, AND buy me a Nintendo Switch!_ No, you’re just thinking that’s a damn fine ass—end of thought!

Well, the cool things is, it’s the same way for your gay friends. Phil Robertson, the patriarch of _Duck Dynasty_, once made a statement saying homosexuality didn’t make sense to him because vaginas are so much more attractive than another man’s asshole. What he didn’t understand when he said this is that attractiveness is subjective; it doesn’t matter if he thinks another man’s asshole is yucky, it could still be another guy’s wonderwall. It’s a completely subjective thing, and one person’s preferences don’t negate the validity of another’s!

Now—and get ready for this bombshell—the same overarching concept applies to the trans community as well: you don’t have to personally understand the trans experience for trans identities to still be very real and 100% valid. (And actually, unless you’re trans yourself, you never really will understand the trans experience because you’re not meant to. This is just how life works.) Trans peeps are gonna continue to identify the way they identify regardless of whether you, personally, can understand what they’re experiencing. If this isn’t making sense to you, think of it this way: does Debra from work understand why you broke up with a nice boy like Jake? Well, assuming it’s any of Debra’s goddamn business, she should trust that you had your reasons! The validity of your break up with Jake is not dependent upon Debra knowing why you did it.

This concept may seem weird to you, but I’d bet you’re actually pretty used to it because it happens all the time. You don’t understand what your aunt finds sexy about your uncle, and yet, somehow, you still have cousins. This isn’t the fucking Illuminati’s work. You don’t need to understand what your aunt and uncle find sexy about each other to know that they still find each other attractive. You’re not angrily demanding her to explain to you, _well, his short penis is a very good fit for my shallow vagina, and as such, I feel an insatiable, animalistic lust for his buggy orgasm eyes._ No! You just know that it’s real, end of story.

Now, don’t get me wrong, as humans, it’s nice to understand things. I remember one time when my mom asked me what _specifically_ I thought about guys was attractive, and somehow, somewhere, in the slough of word diarrhea I choked on while trying to articulate my feelings, she came to the realization that the things I liked about men were the same things she liked about men. Suddenly she understood where I was coming from, and it improved our relationship. However, these experiences are rare, and you shouldn’t wait for them to be a better human being. I, for example, may never understand what people find attractive about women. You think Brenda’s sexy? Good for you, bud; all I know is I’d have an easier time masturbating to beef stew.

I remember when I first came out as gay to my mother. Although it had gone smoothly at the time, she later confided to me that, when it happened, she “felt like she had lost her son,” she didn’t know who I was, and that it felt like she was “talking to a stranger.” Well, she also told me that one of the experiences that best helped her to get past these feelings was that conversation where we exchanged notes on what we find attractive about guys. What would have happened if we’d never had this exchange? 

If you don’t believe there’s validity to other sexual and gender identities—if you think your asexual niece just hasn’t found the right boy yet, your bisexual daughter is going through a phase, or that your transgender cousin has fallen victim to a fad, I urge you to consider that your personal convictions may not mean jack shit. I urge you to open your heart and mind to a wider worldview than you once held, both for your sake and for the sake of others. I was lucky to have found some common ground with my mom, shared experiences that she could develop understanding from. Don’t wait for this. Don’t let your love and respect for your friends, family, and neighbors be conditional upon you having some sort of “a-ha moment” that may never come. We _all_ deserve better than that.
