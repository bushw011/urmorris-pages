Hey Morris fam, it’s that time of the biennial: time to register to vote! To learn how to register to vote, turn to the back of this paper: MCSA has purchased a very nice and informative ad (in color!) for you to learn how to register to vote!

Additionally, if I am being completely honest, don’t register to vote in your hometown; please register to vote in Morris.

You are here, in Morris, for basically eight months out of the year. Multiply that by four since you are here for four academic seasons, and, out of the 48 months you’ll be in undergrad, you’ll be in Morris for 32 of them.

Chances are, you think it’s pretty stupid that we don’t have air conditioning in any of the dorms and in a little less than half of the apartments. 

I bet you also look at the computers all over campus and ask, “why do some of them use Windows 7?” 

Maybe you think it’s absurd that it takes literally the entire year to build an elevator on the side of Blakely despite projections that it would be finished in a semester.
Or that the East Parking Lot should have been done during the summer, yet we’ve received two notifications telling us to move our cars from the lot only to find out that they, for whatever reason, can’t start right away. 

Have you been to Camden Hall and noticed that the office spaces look like they haven’t been treated for asbestos and lead abatement? 

Also, when the hell have you heard of a library proliferating as much mold as Briggs?

Seriously; you’re gonna be here for a good chunk of your life—this is your education for which you’re paying around $20,000 a year. 

UMM isn’t going to magically come into a lot of money. If we increased tuition, we’d be competing with private universities who can shake their crazy endowments in our faces, and we’d be excluding our constituency (which is lower-middle class and rural folks). Additionally, the University system couldn’t care less about every campus that’s not the Twin Cities campus or the Duluth campus. We could just squeeze out more gifts from alumni and try to encourage richer students to attend, however that is leading to UMM losing financial independence (i.e. the ability to choose how to spend our money) and an unnecessary focus on porky student services (i.e. decreasing the amount of money we can spend on things that directly affect education, like hiring diverse faculty or providing better scholarships)
I do not mean to insult alumni nor folks in departments one might consider “porky,” however the massive cuts suffered by the University in the past 20 years have led to a degradation in the quality of services offered to students attending this campus.

So, how can we fix it?

Vote.

I’m not gonna tell you who to vote for, but please vote. Vote for someone who actually cares about the University—who is responsive to your questions and has a track record of voting for University bonding bills. The politicians we select for this next Minnesota Legislature will decide who will comprise the Board of Regents in 2019—Do you really want to live for the next 32 months in a dilapidating campus?

Then vote for someone who has your interests in mind.

If you don’t know who represents your views, then ask. 

There is no such thing as a bad question in politics—there is only regret because you didn’t vote.
