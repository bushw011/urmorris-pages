With the semester starting up and workloads starting to grow, I just wanted to take a minute to remind everyone that while studying is very important, and while putting sleep off to prepare for an exam or finish a reading may seem tempting, sleep is just as vital.

This isn’t an excuse to neglect your homework, but rather a reason to think more about your own habits of self care. As a society, we tend to prioritize work over health, and while I can see why this mindset seems like it would benefit us, I believe that it does not.

Especially in an academic setting, there is a sense that sleep is not as highly valued as it should be, and that there is some air of accomplishment in staying up late to finish an assignment or study for a test, then get up early for an 8 a.m. class and managing to stay awake throughout the day. This is a dangerous mindset. 

Our minds and bodies need an adequate amount of rest to properly function, and even if we don’t notice a difference in our functionality, sleep deprivation can severely impede what we are capable of doing.

There is a common mindset that our mental health, and what we need to do in order to maintain and improve it, is not as important as work we need to accomplish. This is problematic for a few reasons. 

The first is that it belittles the importance of our mental health, which needs to be taken more seriously in the world we live in. The brain is an organ which is afflicted with conditions and disorders just as any other organ in our bodies, and yet, there exists the mindset that mental conditions such as depression and anxiety can simply be powered through and are not as validated as other medical conditions, such as a kidney infection. We often feel too much pressure from our professional lives to set our personal lives aside, and as a result, can forget to take care of ourselves in addition to taking care of our professional responsibilities.

The second is that it implies that people who focus on their mental health are not as motivated or successful as people who prioritize work over it. This is not only untrue, but can create unnecessary guilt around prioritizing mental health, which can then lead to worsening one’s mental health.

Once, when I suggested to a friend that she de-stress and focus on herself rather than attend a club activity out of obligation to other club members, she nearly thought I was joking. Our conversation reminded me of the sheer amount of pressure we put on ourselves to deal with the rest of our lives before our mental health, and of the guilt we are made to feel for prioritizing ourselves. I have heard that it is selfish to focus on one’s own health before attending to other obligations, that taking time to focus on one’s mental health is a sign of weakness, and that making sure to get a proper amount of sleep is simply an excuse for laziness. 
None of this is true. There is a difference between not valuing work and choosing to put it second to another aspect of your life. We need to recognize the importance of our mental health and refrain from feeling shame at prioritizing it.

So, students of UMM, I encourage you all to evaluate your own mental health as the semester continues, to be aware of which of your behaviors or other aspects of your lives are influencing it, and to try to prioritize yourselves.
