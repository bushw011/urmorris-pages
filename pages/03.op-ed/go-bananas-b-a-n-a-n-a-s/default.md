If you have inhabited this Earth long enough to begin your journey into the world of bananas in anything but banana form, I think you might find yourself in a similar situation as me. As a small child, I found that bananas - whether they were pureed into baby food or simply diced up into choking safe pieces - were a fruit of the God(s). My opinion has not changed in the last 22 (and some change) years that I have existed as a being in our dimension of existence, but my experience with bananas has definitely been warped throughout the years. 

Let me explain. You see, I think it started with those little Runts candies. Seemingly innocent, as a child I dug right into the small bowl that was always kept full on the right side of my grandmother’s coffee table. Like I eat my M&Ms and Skittles (not at the same time), I shoved the little, bright-colored pieces into my mouth with unassuming glee. It only took moments for me to faintly recognize what was once a memory of the God(s) fruit banana and choke the candies down my throat away from my tongue. To this day I cannot eat Runts. In fact I cannot eat Runts, Banana Laffy Taffy, Banana Now and Later, or Circus Peanuts (yes they are technically banana flavored). 

And it doesn’t stop there! The candy and snack industries have also incorporated this awful flavoring attempt into mixes. Have you been to the local Morris Dairy Queen lately? Not one time does the menu simply state “strawberry julius” or “strawberry shake.” It seems that these days strawberry isn’t allowed to leave the house without an overly controlling banana attached to its every move. And to top it all off, banana then makes me an inconvenience to the employees of these establishments, because without fail, every time I order a strawberry julius, the employee is required to ask, “just strawberry?” as if the banana has heard me refuse its presence in my drink and has been #triggered by the very thought. Yes, I do just want the strawberry. Thank you very much. 

Maybe you’re thinking to yourself, “This chick is insane” or “I thought I liked banana flavored candy.” Although the first one is certainly true, I am here and now making a plea to all Morris students to reevaluate their candy and snack choices. Do you really want to continue your life of banana flavoring, the sad excuse of a memory of what banana once was? Or do you want to stand up to banana’s insecurities and eat the fruit as it was intended to be eaten? Bananas grow on trees, not in factories. Stop cheating yourself. Eat them as they were meant to be eaten.
