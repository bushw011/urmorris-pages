Nobody could have anticipated the social and cultural impact that would begin on May 1, 1999, not even its own creator, marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. He may have seen moderate success working on another semi-popular Nicktoon, Rocko’s Modern Life, but nothing beat out the industry titan that became SpongeBob SquarePants. For almost two decades now, the whimsical sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea has captured the hearts and minds of children and adults alike. Hillenburg, however, would meet a different fate: in 2017, Hillenburg was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), yet still he fought on for the show. On November 26, 2018, Hillenburg passed away, after more than a year of battling ALS. His legacy will outlive him for generations to come. 

Graduating from Humboldt State University in 1984 with a major in marine science and a minor in art, Hillenburg went on to teach Marine Biology at the Orange County Marine Institute. During this time, he created what would eventually become the basis for SpongeBob: a comic called The Intertidal Zone, which featured many marine life forms, including Bob the Sponge, who would later evolve into the titular character of the cartoon. In 1989, Hillenburg quit his job in order to attend the California Institute of Arts (CalArts), graduating in 1991 with his thesis film, Wormholes, a short film about the theory of relativity.

By 1993, Hillenburg had been signed on to work on Rocko’s Modern Life as a director with Nickelodeon. After a few people on staff read some of The Intertidal Zone, they urged Hillenburg to pitch the show to Nickelodeon. In 1997, the pitch for the show, which featured Hawaiian music, Hillenburg in a Hawaiian shirt, and models of each of the characters, Nickelodeon executives approved the show, and gave Hillenburg his budget. On May 1, 1999, SpongeBob SquarePants aired as Nickelodeon’s very first Saturday-morning cartoon.

SpongeBob isn’t just a great children’s television program; it’s iconic, rivaling even The Simpsons as the fifth longest-running American animated television series in
terms of longevity. But the content of the show really stands out. Iconic episodes like Band Geeks inspired an entire generation of children to take up a flute, trombone, or oboe and join their band clubs. Pizza Delivery and The Camping Episode got entire swathes of six-to-twelve year olds to scream the songs at seven in the morning. Chocolate with Nuts (probably) got so many children begging their parents for Hershey’s candy bars. The Fry Cook Games has one of the best jokes in the series, where the fish lights the olympic torch, only to promptly be set on fire himself. 

If one episode stands out above the rest in terms of classic SpongeBob, it would have to be The Krusty Krab Training Video. This episode so brilliantly lampoons classic training videos for restaurants, office work, and retail with classic SpongeBob inserts and gags. From the history of Mr. Krabs, the series’ trademark cheapskate, to the “hoopla” customers make over every single Krabby Patty, to one of the most hype ending songs in the series that many a child can sing after hearing only the first “DUN.”

Of course, none of this would be even possible with out the incredible voice cast. Tom Kenny, who has been with the show from the very beginning as the voice of
the titular sponge, kills it in nearly every episode. With a delightfully charming, yet equally annoying, voice that annoyed parents and made kids squeal with glee, Kenny has become the voice of a generation. Bill Fagerbakke, also known as Patrick Star, brings a delightfully stupid bass voice to the cast, creating a great contrast between him and SpongeBob. Roger Bumpass, the voice of Squidward, has also provided an annoyed, but relatable, voice to a character who we all loathed as children, but somehow sympathize with more as we all grow up.

That’s another great element about SpongeBob: in a way, the early episodes grew up with all of the kids who watched it in the early 2000’s. SpongeBob was us as children, and now, as university students, we relate with Squidward. We struggle to find jobs, we have a hard time feeling creatively inspired, and we even wonder if
those around us who are so happy would maybe take it down a notch. However, all of it is presented in a way that doesn’t insult adult’s intelligence, and lets us understand, if not question, Squidward. The show may poke fun at the fact that “remember: no employee wants to be a Squidward” but that’s okay: we all hit that point at times.

Hillenburg would go on to direct, produce, and write both SpongeBob movies, which are considered the series’ high point by many. The original SpongeBob SquarePants Movie is amazing in its’ own right, with fabulous jokes, comedic timing, a heartwarming message to both children and adults all leading up to one of the best songs of the mid 2000’s, Goofy Goober ROCK. It’s incredible, and worth a watch even today. 

Hillenburg never gave up hope for the series. After leaving the series in 2002 to work on the movie and taking a break, he returned in 2015 to work on the latest two seasons, before contracting ALS. Despite this, he continued to work and pour all of his love and passion into the show that took the world by storm. With his passing, the world will not forget him. Currently, there is a petition to get the song that plays at the end of Band Geeks, “Sweet Victory,” to play at the 2019 Super Bowl LIII, just as it did at the end of Band Geeks at the Bubble Bowl. Succeeded by an incredible show, an attraction at Minnesota’s Mall of America, and an attraction at Universal Studios, Spongebob will never die. It’ll continue to live, and keep on smiling, just like SpongeBob, and of course, Stephen Hillenburg. 

Rest in Peace, Steve. You will never be forgotten.
