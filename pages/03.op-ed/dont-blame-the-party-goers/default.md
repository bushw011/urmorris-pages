In the last few weeks, I have witnessed our student body, in real-time, mentally prepare to blame itself for the inevitable COVID-19 outbreak that cancels in-person instruction and sends people away from campus. There have been countless posts on social media, warning people to be mindful of social distancing and facemask protocols, and avoid partying like the plague (literally). When the finger-pointing begins, it is obvious that most of the responsibility will be shouldered by hypothetical, party-going peers, above any other individuals or institutions that could have prevented this. 

Okay, yeah, they will kind of deserve it! No doubt about that. But what can you do? No amount of Instagram stories warning them not to ruin the semester for everybody can fix stupid. There are no lessons learned because even the hardest partiers would never accept the blame personally. Even if someone did accept responsibility, what do we expect them to do, aside from giving us a target to air our grievances onto? We’re all human—human behavior is naturally confusing, self-destructive, and dumb. It’s the most common chronic, incurable disease in the world, and it thrives the most in spaces with large groups. 

Think about the freshmen—the last group on campus to be known for their wisdom, life experience, and smart decisions. Just in the last year, they have missed out on prom, graduation, and the accompanying after-parties. Now we are asking them to sit down and wait a semester or two to indulge in the romanticized, Hollywood college experience that they have been promised. Is it even fair to expect them to act responsibly? 

To have people’s safety and health reliant on individual action and personal responsibilities of collective groups of human beings—college-going human beings, no less—is folly. And no one understands this more than the administrators who were responsible for the decision to come back to campus; these are people who spend their careers dealing with the irresponsibility and unreliability of some college students. 

I think, instead of making partiers a scapegoat, we should be ready to place responsibility on the people who were in charge of making the decision to come to campus in the first place. Ultimately, they understood the consequences of their decision, and they are also the only people profiting from that decision. There is nothing we can gain from pointing fingers at each other, and there might not be much the university can do for us after all is said and done. But I do know that blaming party-goers isn’t going to be what gets us a housing refund. 

If we do, however, somehow make it to the end of the semester with no outbreak, I think all of us should have a sense of pride for our campus and student body. Because that would make us one of the first groups in human history to overcome our own stupidity for the common good of each other. But unless that happens, all of us should be prepared to leave the party-goers alone.
