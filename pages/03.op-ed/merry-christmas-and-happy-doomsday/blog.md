With the end of the semester just around the corner, the holidays are in the air — and so is the stress of final exams. During one of my classes this week, we actually took time aside to talk about how students were feeling, what was stressing us out, and how we could solve these problems. A recurring theme, aside from the stress of our impending finals, was the stress students felt from current events in the world.

Many students reported that a large factor of their stress was simply the inability to escape from stressful aspects of life. For many, academics, work, family dynamics, social media, and current world news is all contributing to high stress levels. No matter which direction we turn, it seems as though we can always find something that induces stress.

On top of all of that, our generation faces a new type of stress. For many, social media has been a large part of our lives from an early age, and we were the first generation to grow up with a digital receipt for all of our actions. Adolescence is always stressful and always includes mistakes. But when we combine this with the ability to instantly compare our lives to the lives of our peers, the pressure to maintain a positive digital reputation, and the ability of the internet to immortalize our mistakes, the pressure on modern youth to mature at a younger age heavily increases. As some of my classmates pointed out in our discussion, it is difficult to grow into an adult when we are expected to conduct ourselves responsibly for the sake of our future selves at an age when many of us are still trying to figure out who we want those future selves to be.

Because of this, the internet can be a reminder of our past mistakes as well as an instant method of receiving stressful news about the rest of the world. I don’t know about the rest of my peers, but to me, it seems as though the things going wrong in the world pile up quickly and there is rarely news of solutions to these problems being found. Now, perhaps that’s just because I’m not in touch with current events as much as I should be or because it’s often easier to see the negative aspects of our world than the positive. But there are certainly problems that our generation is going to need to try to solve as we leave young adulthood and enter the mechanisms of the rest of the world. And while I hope that we are able to at least begin to solve these problems, I think there are aspects of the way we conduct problem-solving in our society that are preventing us from getting anywhere.

It seems that we are so preoccupied with trying to solve problems in a certain way that the urgency of solving the actual problem gets lost. The easiest way for
me to explain this is through the example of political parties. America is incredibly divided by the conflict between its political parties, and this seems to be especially  prevalent in recent years. Take the issue of school shootings, for example. Regardless of one’s political affiliation or lack thereof, I am fairly certain that everyone  agrees that we should try to do something to stop shootings from happening. However, different political parties have conflicting ideas of how to go about solving 
this problem, and their unwillingness to compromise in an act of what seems to me to be nothing more than a stubborn sense of loyalty to a specific belief system prevents them from working to solve the actual problem. In other words, although all political parties would like to prevent shootings from occurring, their inability to agree on a solution to the issue is preventing progress from being made.

I know that I likely sound naive and that politics are much more complicated than getting a few people to decide on one solution that will magically improve the entire country overnight. But my point is that people are simply too divided to begin to find solutions. I see this on campus just as much as I see it in the rest of the world. We are too at odds with one another to tackle the problems we face in a reasonable time frame, and I fear that by the time we are ready to put aside our differences and come up with long-lasting solutions to the problems we face, our planet may not be able to support us for much longer. But the heavens have not opened up like a book just yet — doomsday is not upon us and we still have time to try to face the problems we have created for ourselves. I only hope that we can find a way to honestly communicate with each other without obligation to the social labels we put so much importance on and, for once, just take action.
