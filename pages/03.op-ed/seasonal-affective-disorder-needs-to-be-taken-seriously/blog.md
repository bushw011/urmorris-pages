With winter fast approaching, I thought I would take a moment to talk to you all about Seasonal Affective Disorder, also called Seasonal Depression. This disorder is officially recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and is especially prevalent in the midwest, yet it is not often taken seriously.

Because the nature of Seasonal Affective Disorder is to set in during the late fall and/or winter months, then regress during the spring and/or summer months, some people do not view it as a legitimate depressive disorder, but rather an unfortunate bout of sadness due to the arrival of snow. While the presence of snow can seem to be a trigger for Seasonal Affective Disorder, it actually has more to do with the change in light during the winter season and the changes that occur in the circadian rhythms of individuals with Seasonal Affective Disorder.

Everyone has their own internal rhythms that keep them on a 24-hour cycle. These cycles are reset by light cues, and when winter comes and natural light fades earlier in our days, some people experience biological changes as a result of winter’s shorter days and longer nights. The onset of depressive symptoms in Seasonal Affective Disorder may also be due to changes in one’s melatonin levels.

Melatonin is a hormone which contributes to the body’s sleep-wake cycle. In people with Seasonal Affective Disorder, melatonin levels increase during winter days. This causes the depressive symptom of growing sleepier in the daytime and, in some people, becoming too tired to properly function during the day, which can lead to the loss of the will to participate in one’s regular activities.

Since changes in natural light are likely the cause of Seasonal Affective Disorder, one of the most effective treatments for this disorder is light therapy. This usually involves putting a light next to one’s bed, which will then emit soft pulses of light at dawn and dusk. This light is not bright enough to awaken the individual undergoing light therapy, but it is bright enough to affect their internal rhythms. Light can still reach a sleeping person’s brain through their eyelids, and when this form of light therapy is applied, it can work to reset an individual’s internal clock, causing their biological rhythms to run on a consistent cycle as it would during summer months. This form of light therapy has been very effective at treating individuals with Seasonal Affective Disorder. Some forms of light therapy simply involve spending time in a clinic room with specialized lighting while awake, which produces similar effects to lamp therapy.

Seasonal Affective Disorder has only been found to affect 2-4 percent of the overall population in the United States, but this in no way means that it shouldn’t be taken seriously. It is a form of Major Depressive Disorder, and can seriously affect the mental health of those who develop it. It is far more than the ‘cabin fever’ many people experience during winter from limited time outside, and often benefits greatly from professional treatment, just as any other form of depression does. There is also a less severe form of Seasonal Affective Disorder, called Winter Blues, which causes similar symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder, but at milder levels of intensity. It is also possible for someone who lives in a milder climate to develop Winter Blues, move to a northern climate, and experience a shift to Seasonal Affective Disorder.

Whether you are feeling cooped up this winter or are experiencing depressive symptoms, I urge you to keep your mental health in mind as you move through the remainder of the year. If you feel that you may need professional help with your symptoms, consider looking into the therapy offered on campus, or talking to one of the Let’s Talk counselors on Mondays from 9 a.m.-11 a.m in Briggs Library Room 326 or Thursdays from 10:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m Multi-Ethnic Resource Center.
