**By Thomas Pederson, Writer** _originally published in Issue 4, Volume 30 of The University Register on Friday, November 3, 2017_

A bit of advice for all of you with a few years left in college: pick a major that requires the fewest credits to complete and use the rest of your time to take classes or be involved in extracurriculars that interest you. Take it from someone who blindly followed the expected academic pathway until I nearly burnt out to the point of no return.

The primary focus of a university is not to provide you with an education, it is to sell you a product. That product comes in the form of a degree that signifies you have exactly the same baseline knowledge and experience as everyone else spewed out by the institution with “Biology” or “Psychology” on their piece of paper.

This product is complete bullshit. Even if you pass all the same classes with all the same grades as your peers, you do not have the same knowledge and experience as anyone else. You are an individual with individual interests and individual aspirations. And this individuality is reflected in the experience you take away from a class. If you spend your time in classes you find pointless, boring, or irrelevent to you aspirations, what you take away is a waste of time and a waste of money.

So, tailor your education based on what you want to learn. Don’t allow the profit-driven institution to tailor you to fit their idea of proper education. The university is too focused on getting four years of tuition out of the next generation of touring, starry-eyed high school students to release that education should be individualized, not homogenized.

Don’t get bogged down by four years of required courses you don’t give two shits about, just because the major includes three classes you are really interested in. Put as little effort into what the damn piece of paper says when you graduate as you can, and take the twelve classes you are really interested in.

Don’t let the education system take all the joy out of your education.
