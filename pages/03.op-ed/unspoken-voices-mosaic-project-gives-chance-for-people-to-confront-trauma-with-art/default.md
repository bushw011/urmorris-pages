Join Unspoken Voices this year on Saturday, October 6 from 2p.m.—5:30p.m. at Slutwalk-Twin Cities for our new project, an incredible healing opportunity called Fragmentary: A Mosaic Project

What is this healing opportunity? Imagine breaking a plate. Now put it back together. It’s whole, right? Wrong. Look again. There are cracks and scars where damage was done to the plate. Now imagine that the plate is a person. If you cause damage to that person, but apologize, try to fix it, or use some glue, the plate can be made whole again, right? Maybe...but it will never be exactly the same again. When people go through pain or traumatic experiences they can heal from them, but still end up with scars. Do these scars make a person less of a person? Less beautiful? Less worthy of love? No, they are still a whole person, just changed.

Unspoken Voices will be providing plates of different varieties for people to write on and decorate explaining what they feel “broke” them. This is a chance for participants to write down the causes for their scars, whether physical or metaphorical. The decorators will then have the chance to smash and break what broke them. After the plates are broken, there will be time to make them into something beautiful and new. The pieces from the shattered plates will be added to a communal mosaic that Unspoken Voices will showcase at different events.


What does this project mean for one survivor in particular? Unspoken Voices Board Member Ashlee Bednar shared her personal story:

“This opportunity is huge for me. I was sexually assaulted three times in under a year, all by people I knew.  It scarred me for life. For a while, I never thought I would move past what had happened to me, move past the pain those people had caused me. Now I know I was wrong.  Sure I will always have the scars and sure I will always be affected by the choices those “friends” made, however I am a new me. I am stronger than I used to be and I now can help others who have endured trauma or been hurt. Fragmentary will let me tangibly write down who and what changed my life, let me smash it, and then allow me to show the beauty within. It will let me pick up the pieces of my life and create something new. I’m excited to share this events with victim/survivors like myself and with others that have gone through different struggles. We all have things in our past that have changed us, events that have attempted to tear us down. It’s up to us to pick up the pieces and make sure we are the most strong and beautiful human we can be. It’s time for us to show the world our strength and beauty.”

Another member, Desmond Homann, shared why this event, along with the organization itself, is so important:

“Unspoken Voices provides many creative and community-oriented outlets for victims of power-based violence. The events, performances, and other work we do benefits those who have experienced bullying, abuse, conflict, sexual assault, and other issues of violence. As someone who has been through many different instances of power-based violence, especially sexual violence and bullying due to my sexual orientation, I’ve really appreciated and come to love all the work I do with this group. I’m excited that we have the opportunity to share this powerful event and also be a part of the Slutwalk. I think that this mosaic project specifically is a beautiful creative outlet for a lot of people who may still be holding onto the things that have hurt them. This should be a very relieving and healing project that allows us to let go of stress while also creating art with others who feel the same way.”
