Before I start, I just want to say that the new barrier-free test location at the Armory is fantastic, and anyone even somewhat responsible for getting that established as a permanent thing deserves some credit. Everyone should get tested there fairly often from here on out.

That said, I remain fairly concerned about the return to campus in January. While UMM administrators deserve to be pretty pleased with how relatively well this semester turned out, it would take a fairly miraculous turnaround for mid-January COVID conditions to be even around as kind as those of mid-August, and obviously the weather will drive us to spend even more time in shared indoor spaces. There are three things I would like to see UMM adopt going forward.

The first is frequent testing of the on-campus population. The University of Wisconsin’s campuses require every on-campus resident to be tested at least once per week for COVID, and it is frankly embarrassing that Minnesota is letting its neighbors to the East outdo us. Testing is great for many reasons, but one is that we will have an effective barometer of how we are progressing as a campus. The current COVID dashboard is certainly better than nothing (and if you scroll down the page there might be more data than you thought!), but the numbers lack context and positive case numbers mean little unless they are plotted against total test numbers.
There are obviously legal barriers to acquiring test numbers currently, and the obvious workaround is to conduct our own mandatory testing. This happens at peer institutions, and I have yet to hear a good reason why it can happen at UW and not at UMN. I imagine the reason is very much financial, and as such the ball is in the court of the larger system, and not our local administration. Still, I would hope that the desire for this at UMM is very much expressed to those system leaders.

Second, I believe that time spent in Dining Services must be minimized. I remain aghast that Sodexo has dragged its feet on making its order-ahead app available, and as a consequence I believe that Sodexo must transfer all unused meals this semester to next semester. It looks like the app is finally somewhat close to ready, but certainly not enough that UMM or Sodexo has seen the need to advertise it. I would like to see a much, much stronger culture of ordering food ahead of time come spring semester, because standing in line for food seems like an avoidable risk of spread.

Lastly, I highly encourage UMM to investigate the possibility of starting the semester with a two week campus-wide quarantine. I do not personally think the strongly suggested quarantine over the two weeks prior to move-in day is quite enough. There are a lot of logistical questions of how this would be handled, namely how meals would be delivered, and I understand that. Still, in the event that January’s COVID numbers are truly dire, this could prove a necessary step that must be planned for.

I think next semester presents the true challenge of the COVID crisis. I really do think it was easier before and will be easier thereafter. I have been impressed with this campus’ commitment to our new reality. But especially at the system level, I have found the measures taken fairly lax and disappointing. I hope by January I can be a little more hopeful that our University is the model to the community I know it can be.
