Want to see everyone on campus suddenly agree that biological sex and gender are the same thing? All you have to do is talk about abortion and then suddenly even the most far left people who claim “there are infinitely many genders completely separate from your biological sex,” will agree to view individuals through biological sex. I know this to be true because one common defense I often hear against my pro-life stance is: “You’re male so you don’t get to have an opinion on this matter.” This is probably the worst argument one can make not only about abortion but in a debate in general.

My problem with this argument is that it seems to be specifically oriented to abortion and not anything else. We never hear a person tell someone “You’re not a police officer so you don’t get an opinion on police brutality.” We would also consider the person who makes the statement, “You can’t tell me I can’t perform conversion therapy on my homosexual son because you never raised a homosexual child,” to be insane. Ultimately, this argument is just a dodge that refuses to acknowledge the real arguments. In any debate, if your best argument is to disregard another person’s argument entirely--based on their race or gender--you’re admitting that they beat your argument and that you must resort to sexism and racism to win.

We also need to address the fact that the unborn is a human with a right to not be killed. Basic biology states that two humans having sex will create another human offspring and never a non-human offspring. Ignoring this basic concept is to be completely ignorant of the fundamentals of biology. We have also learned through CAT scans and other forms of medical technology that an infant in the womb has unique DNA, a heartbeat, and even detectable brain waves within the first trimester of pregnancy. From a purely logical standing these factors would define both a unique individual as well as a conscious individual in every conceivable case other than when in the womb for some reason. Apparently, telling a parent to not kill their child is “controlling a woman’s body.”

Pro-lifers aren’t trying to control a woman’s body; this is just another dodge. We simply want people to stop killing babies for existing. Nobody argues that I am trying to control women when I say “I believe parents shouldn’t beat their children.” This is a perfect example of special pleading, where a group demands we make an exception because their argument is wrong. 

I’m also not a woman but I assume that almost all women are capable of saying “no” to sex. There’s this weird concept where you don’t have to have sex, especially if you are unable to buy birth control! Contrary to popular belief, most abortions are not done because of rape or life of the mother but because the mother didn’t want the child. If you choose to have sex, you should be responsible for the child or not have sex at all. We’re not animals, we are capable of controlling our own desires for sex if we accept the possibility of having a baby.  

Too bad none of this matters because I’m a man and many pro-choicers care more about that than facts or evidence. I should know better than to come to this campus with facts and evidence for an objective argument. In reality I should have just decided whose argument is most logical based on a person’s gender rather than logic. I will be sure to consider the Morris philosophy of “care more about the gender of the person making the argument than the argument itself.”
