It was Monday, February 19, 2018, about 8 a.m., and I was browsing Twitter before my classes (as one does). While doing so, I stumbled upon a seemingly innocuous tweet from Syd Bauer. She simply asked a question: “Where is Louie’s Upper Level?” She was being facetious to be sure, however, I was intrigued: where exactly is Louie’s Upper Level?

Louie’s Lower Level is not the original Louie’s Lower Level. There are actually five different Louie’s Lower Levels: the present one in the Student Center here at UMM, one that used to be located in the basement of Behmler, one that was located at the University of Arizona, Tuscon, one located at the University of New Mexico, and another—the original—a dive bar located in Chicago. 
So, where is Louie’s Upper Level? Presently at UMM, Oyate is above Louie’s Lower Level, thus one could consider Oyate “Louie’s Upper Level.” However, the Student Center is not the original location of Louie’s Lower Level at UMM—so what was above it in its original location?

At the crux of the establishment of the University of Minnesota, Morris, Louie’s Lower Level was located in the basement of present-day Behmler, then-called the Dining Hall. Louie’s Lower Level was not only a hangout spot—complete with a television, pool table, and pop machine—but also a commuter’s lounge. 
In its early days, UMM was considered by some to be a “suitcase campus,” meaning that a plurality of students and faculty would literally drive to Morris each day to attend classes. To placate this constituency, Louie’s Lower Level was established, offering food and drink to those who commuted. However, I digress—the “Upper Level” to this Louie’s was the Dining Hall.

However, the Louie’s Lower Level at UMM is not the original. LLL’s namesake is from the University of Arizona. There are two stories that explain why we stole the name from the University of Arizona. According to Dr. James Togeas, Professor Emeritus of Chemistry, the hangout spot was named by Bruce McGrew, who preceded John Ingle as a painter at UMM—both are originally from the University of Arizona. However, in most official documents, it is Rodney Briggs, the first Chancellor (then called Dean) of UMM, who stole the name. 

If one is to believe that Briggs stole the name, one also has to ask how Briggs came into contact with the University of Arizona. If you believe that McGrew brought the name with him, he could have brought it while migrating to UMM from UA. Despite the unclear origins of its name, it is clear that the name of the hangout spot in the Student Union of the University of Arizona at Tuscon is UMM Louies’ namesake. 
When the old student center at the University of Arizona was being built in 1951, students became attached to its basement—a small, dark room with an unfinished ceiling and a dirt floor covered in saw dust. The next school year, the space was christened “Louie’s Lower Level.” The “Upper Level” of Louie’s at the University of Arizona was student union space. 

What type of student union space? I don’t know. The Admissions department at the University of Arizona didn’t know, and the Student Union couldn’t be reached for comment. However, it was definitely student union space. Could it have been other food options? I doubt that. According to a few articles written in the _Arizona Daily Star_ (archived on www.Tucson.com), Louie’s Lower Level was threatened with closure on numerous occasions due to grease fires, and in its place would have been a fast food mall. What would be the need for a fast food mall if there were other quick options for food in the student center at the time?
Louie’s Lower Level at the University of Arizona met its demise in the November of 2000 when it sustained extensive damage from a grease fire, the third in its almost 50-year history, and was closed indefinitely. After this tragic event, plans for a new student union were being drawn, and its plans did not include a space for another Louie’s Lower Level. A nostalgic article published in The Arizona Daily Star in 2000 laments “thanks for a great run Louie—whoever you are.”

That’s just it, who is “Louie?” The Louie’s Lower Level at the University of Arizona also stole its name—this time from a dive bar that operated around this time in Chicago. Bill Varney, Student Union director at the University of Arizona from 1958-1984, said that a student chose this name because both places were similar—they both were located in unfinished spaces that had dirt floors covered in saw dust. 
I sent an email to the Chicago Historical Society in hopes of receiving vindication for my quest to reveal the location of the original Louie’s, but, after looking into old Chicago Tribunes and the local telephone directories, they were unable to find record of a Louie’s Lower Level. This was disheartening because, in my opinion, to truly know “Louie’s Upper Level” would be to discover the establishment that existed above the original Lower... but alas, it was a dive, and these establishments produced scant documentation of their existence.

We may never find out what the true “Upper Level” of Louie’s was, but maybe that is okay. If we illuminate the answer to this question, will we not possess a certain aura of hubris—which will quickly be followed by the Sicilian Campaign? Will our egos not inflate to such a volume that we set out to construct another tower of Babel? Will we not think ourselves as more immortal than the gods themselves? I feel that the shroud of wonder surrounding the question, “what is Louie’s Upper Level,” is necessary for the vigor of a blissful democracy and a powerful UMM. 

Now that we have discovered the original Louie’s Lower Level by just documenting four of its iterations, what of the fifth? Remember how I said there are five different Louie’s Lower Levels? That is mostly true. At the University of New Mexico, they have a Louie’s Lounge. Their lounge has a very short history, having only been opened in 2013. Sadly, according to Enrollment Specialist Julie Ball, “Louie’s Lounge is named after one of our mascots, Louie Lobo.” (If you are curious, their other mascot is Lucy Lobo).
