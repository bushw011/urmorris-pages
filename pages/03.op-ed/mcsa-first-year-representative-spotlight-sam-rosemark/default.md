**This past Tuesday, I sat down with Sam Rosemark, one of the newly elected freshman representatives of the Morris Campus Student Association (MCSA). A political science and economics double major with a possible Spanish minor, Rosemark is hoping for big changes in the coming semester. **

**Describe yourself in three words.**
> Respectful, responsible, and passionate.

**What does the position of First-year Representative entail? What responsibilities or tasks may the First-year Rep. have?**
> There were three other First-year Representatives elected as well. We serve on the First-year Council for the MCSA. We address issues that come up for first-year students; so, we help make campus a better experience for them. On top of that, we also serve on other committees that are MCSA-specific. I currently serve on a campus assembly committee and the Academic Success committee. 

**What made you interested in the position of First-year Representative?**
> I like to help people. I’m a people person. Being a representative is definitely a way to affect positive change. I also wanted to make sure the freshman voice was heard, because often it’s not. Freshmen don’t feel empowered to give their voice because we’re only freshman; that shouldn’t be the case. 

**What are your main objectives as First-year Representative?** 
> As I campaigned on, [improving] The Dining Hall’s food. I want to make sure we get better quality dining hall food. We don’t have the block meal plans like other campuses have. This is where schools have a block of 500 meals for a semester. Other schools like Crookston pay $2,100 per semester and get 100 Dining Dollars. Twin Cities [students pay] $2,133 per semester [for] 100 Flex Dollars with 10 guest passes. We pay $2,143 for unlimited, and nothing else. We pay more, and get less. 
> How we would fix that is with the contract that is up this year. MCSA has a lot of input in renegotiating that. There is a committee the MCSA is on with Sodexo, so much can happen there. With that, more locally sourced, more organic, and better food would be priorities. Also, even just telling them what students don’t like, and what we do like. 

**Do you like any specific food served in The Dining Hall?**
> The tater tots. The Dining Hall has the potatoes down. 

**How has student leadership played a role in your life?**
> Student leadership has made me a more responsible person. It has made me fairer, and reasonable. I’m more open to people. I’m a very approachable person. I like to have fun. 

**Who are some influential people you look up to?**
> My political science teacher from high school. She is also an alumnus from Morris. She’s been helpful a lot along my journey. My parents have also been influential in my life. 

**What would you like to say to your fellow first-years?**
> The main thing I would say is that I didn’t do this for myself, I’m doing it for the first-year class. With that, I need input, questions, and concerns to help our experience on campus be a good one. 

**Sam plans to be a driving leader for UMM first-years, and a strong proponent of change within the campus student body. Look to future issues to hear from the other first-years representatives elected to the MCSA.
