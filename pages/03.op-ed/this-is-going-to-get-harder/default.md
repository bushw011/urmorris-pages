Amid the extremely harsh news about our new normal, in March, Minnesotans were also blessed with a small reprieve: winter mostly ended on time. Late March and April were, for the most part, incredibly kind months that seemed to beckon everyone to use their newfound free time for fitness and fun in the great outdoors.

As we socially conditioned to wearing masks and keeping our distance, strictly distanced outdoor gatherings became a possibility. As spring sprung, outdoor dining became a solid option for maybe seeing a friend now and again.

Well, our luck has run out. Monday and Tuesday saw our year’s first snowfall—a definitive end to the grace period we were allowed. This virus spreads indoors, and because indoors we must now be, so too must we be alone. Whereas closeness, camaraderie, and familiarity were Morris’ saving graces in an oterwise somewhat lonely setting, even in the kinder season the desolation of Morris was palpable whenever you would realize that it was a Friday night and there really truly was not much to do. There will now be even less.

In a way, Minnesotans have trained for this a little better than most states. A basic sense of safety frequently strands us indoors every winter already. Snow frequently makes travel inadvisable and conditions often are bad enough that even walking somewhere is just a terrible idea. But still, this will be a new level of isolation, and I suspect we are not ready for it. Most states are currently at “uncontrolled spread” levels of increase.

Our initial alarm has mostly waned, and we have, on some level, accepted the new normal. The flattened curve has saved lives, but it has also allowed so many of us to largely avoid seeing the tangible effects of this virus. The truth is that this is not getting any easier. We are not becoming more well-practiced. We are getting comfortable and letting ourselves slip.
