**By Dylan Young, Staff Writer** _Originally published in Issue 5, Volume 32 of The University Register on Friday, November 8, 2019_

In the previous issue of the University Register, I wrote an opinion editorial entitled “Being Brian: Analyzing the Double Standard of Halloween Costumes,” in which I
detailed my experience dressing up as one of my white professors for Halloween. I used it as an opportunity to explain why appropriating cultures for Halloween costumes is wrong and unjustified.

A friend of mine brought an article from the always classy, student-run publication The North Star to my attention because it deals with similar subject matter to my own article. I doubt it was in any way intended as a response to my piece (mostly because Chief Wabasha X, the pen name of the author of the article in question, never specifies whether a Native American dressing up as caucasian writing for the liberal arts professor is okay) but I still feel a responsibility to respond. 

I will not waste my time debating the arguments and rhetoric expressed in the article. The people who need to hear my voice the most would never in a million years listen to me from a place of understanding, and the average liberal arts college student and faculty member already knows that the article disregards any nuance and complexities behind using someone’s culture as a Halloween costume. The person who wrote the article barely believes or has any faith in the words he/she/they writes. If that were not the case, the writer would have the courage to use their actual name instead of masquerading behind a Dakota chief. It was written with the sole intention to incite anger, create division, and breed hatred... as is the case with most articles published by the North Star. 

My first instinct was to burst out my laptop and furiously type out five pages filled with resentment and disrespect that was comparable to the work that is often published by Wabasha X (whoever he/she/they are). But that would be giving them what they want. Instead, I will pray for them; despite the fact that they have done a lot to ensure that they do not deserve that level of sympathy. Any person who dedicates this much of their energy to spreading this level of negativity and burdening the hatred in their heart onto others very clearly lives a miserable life. I pray that they will one day recognize their immaturity and look on these days with regret and embarrassment... I also pray that they learn basic graphic design and proofreading skills.
