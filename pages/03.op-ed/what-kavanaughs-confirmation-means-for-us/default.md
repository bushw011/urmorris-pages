When I first came to Morris this August, I had in my mind a vague sense that colleges could be unsafe places for women. I had heard, of course, the stories of campus sexual assault, and I didn't know what to expect from my new campus. Not being a woman, I was unsure as to the extent that the problem would affect me, but when I began to hear stories from a female friend at a large state school, I worried.

But as I began to experience the campus culture of Morris, it felt different. Maybe it was just the people who I surrounded myself with, but as I looked around each morning as I walked to class, I told myself that this was not the sort of place where such things could happen.

But then, I suppose Yale and Stanford don't feel like the sort of places sexual assault could happen either.

On Saturday, Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate to fill Anthony Kennedy's vacant seat on the Supreme Court, in a 50-48 vote - the closest vote since that of Clarence Thomas. Both men had been credibly accused of sexual assault.

In a dramatic testimony last Thursday, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified against Kavanaugh, solemnly and emotionally detailing a drunken rape attempt when both were teenagers. Later the same day, Kavanaugh delivered a brash, highly partisan dismissal of the claims against him, without providing any evidence of innocence.

What startled me most about Kavanaugh's testimony was not so much the denial itself, nor the force with which it was delivered. It was the response: startling partisanship. Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee spent their time during Dr. Ford's testimony grandstanding and setting themselves up for 2020; Republicans spent their time during Kavanaugh's hearing raging about how the reputation of a good man was being dragged through the mud. Conservative commentators who had earlier been stunned by Ford's story pivoted immediately to robotic defense of the victim of a left-wing smear campaign.

And what angered me most was the discovery that there were people here, in Morris, on this campus, who were willing to follow along with this last viewpoint, who were willing to dismiss an assault victim. It felt like a direct attack on the values of the University. Sexual assault is not, and should not be, a partisan issue.

'Innocent until proven guilty,' cry Kavanaugh's craven defenders. But to be proven guilty there must be evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. Sexual assault cases are rarely prosecuted because there are limits on how much evidence can be gathered, and there have been many lives ruined over far less. Where is the reasonable doubt standard applied to the innocent who are held in jail for weeks, if not months, because they cannot scrape together the money for bail, who will eventually take a plea bargain for a crime they did not commit because the alternative is risking far, far worse? Where is the reasonable doubt for the immigrant children detained by ICE, guilty only of fleeing violence and danger only to be 'misplaced' within the gargantuan prison system? Kavanaugh is certainly guilty of perjury when it comes to his drinking in high school and college, as many of his old companions have stated, and his 'calendars' do not prove anything.

Doubtlessly, Christine Blasey Ford will be tormented for months, if not years to come, by those who believe her to be the figurehead of a campaign to discredit a conservative justice. Doubtlessly, there are those on this campus who have no objection to that. But I say again: sexual assault should not be a partisan issue. The students of Morris, and of schools everywhere, must commit themselves to that fundamental truth, or we will never truly see justice in our lifetimes.
