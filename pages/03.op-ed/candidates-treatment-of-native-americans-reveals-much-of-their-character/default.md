In the months before the 2018 United States elections, back home on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, I organized and participated in several voter registration efforts. During home basketball games I would table in the school’s lobby with registration forms. At halftime I would run out into the bleachers with a pen and clipboard, only to dive into a sea of ‘No thank yous’ and blunt refusals from elders. As much as I would like to take partial credit for Democratic populist Billie Sutton coming closer than any nominee in three decades to beat a Republican to the South Dakota governor seat, I have to admit that I failed to yield significant results with my voter registration efforts.

An understandable distrust for the government and the democratic process is one of the countless factors that have contributed to Native American people having incredibly low rates of voter registration. That means, when a presidential candidate is campaigning, discussing Indigenous policies and tribal relations is not something that is going to win them a significant amount of voters, if at all. And that is exactly why a presidential candidate’s stances on and interactions with Indian country should matter to every American voter, regardless if they will be directly impacted by the policies or not. Because it speaks to their motivation for running for office and integrity as a politician.

When a candidate attends one of the Native American presidential forums, or makes a stop on the Pine Ridge and Standing Rock reservations during their campaign trail, or something as simple as listing Native American people as one of the many groups of people in our country they serve, it should be read as a sign that they are honest about where they stand. It should be read as a sign that they are not lying for votes or campaign contributions.

That is why it should be incredibly worrisome that the new face on the debate stage last Wednesday, the former New York mayor who is slowly rising as one of the frontrunners in the Democratic primary, has only acknowledged the existence of Native American people once during his decades in the public eye. In fact, when you google “Native American people Mike Bloomberg,” the first, and only, results are news articles that describe him as previously suggesting that Native American people should be governed with “a Cowboy hat and a shotgun.” Despite not having any Native American policies on his website, Mike Bloomberg does, however, list plans regarding the ban of e-cigarettes and vape pens; while that may be an important issue to some people, it is hard not to interpret it as taking a stance on a trendy topic for votes.

During Minnesota’s Democratic primary on March 3, and the presidential election in November, voters should pay careful attention to how the candidates treat Native American people. If not because we are an important part of this country, then because their stances can be very revealing to the integrity and honesty they will have as our president.
