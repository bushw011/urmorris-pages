Last weekend, I helped to construct a mosaic that was so much more than an art project. It was a symbol of closure and of community, and a way for participants to confront the negative things in their lives and take control of them.

The project, which Unspoken Voices called Fragmentary, was a way for participants to gain emotional closure through artful, non-violent destruction. Participants considered what they felt had scarred or deeply affected them and wrote it onto a plate, which they were then able to destroy with a hammer. It was a cathartic experience for some, and a way to bond with people who had been through similar experiences. For me, it was also an opportunity to think about things in my life that left me without closure.

As far as people go, I’ve been pretty lucky. I’ve never been a victim of assault or power-based violence, I’ve recovered from any major illnesses I’ve had, I’ve never been in poverty, and I’ve had support from friends and family whenever I have been through a difficult experience. That said, when I thought about what to write on my plate, I found that there were quite a few things to choose from, some of which I hadn’t even realized had deeply affected me until I began to think about them. 

I’ve always been a quiet person. In elementary school, I preferred to read rather than play at recess. After performing in a play where I was required to shout in anger, people told me they were surprised I was capable of screaming. Before speaking aloud, I have a habit of running over my words in my head to make sure I’ve phrased everything correctly, which often results in more silence than it does dialogue. These tendencies have made me thoughtful and reserved, but they have also made me passive and tentative to express myself, and this has sometimes done me more harm than good.

Looking over my completed plate, I realized that each experience I recorded — experiences that had affected me to the point where I had chosen them to represent what fragmented me — could have all been prevented, or at least resolved more immediately, if I had been more assertive. This is not to say that a person who is taken advantage of and is unable to act assertively in their own defense is at fault for their trauma; it is simply something I noticed in my own past, and which enabled me to reflect upon the ways that I respond to things around me.

I don’t think I’ll ever stop being an introvert. I’m not sure I’ll ever stop being cautious. And I don’t think those are negative traits. But for any readers who find themselves in a similar position, consider this advice: It’s okay to be quiet. It’s okay not to feel the need to share your opinions with more than the people you’re close to. It’s okay to stop and take a second to process what you’re going through before you proceed. But don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself or to express how you feel. Don’t feel ashamed of making a mistake once in a while. Find a way to confront the negative things in your life and take control of them. I recommend writing them down and then smashing them with a hammer. It feels pretty great.
