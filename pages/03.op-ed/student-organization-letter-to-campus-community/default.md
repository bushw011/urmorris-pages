Dear Campus Community,

We as a community are in pain and are hurting. This is due to members of our community disrespectfully attacking the identities of marginalized groups. It is up to all of us to come together in unity to express our shared values during this time and denounce actions that hurt our friends and loved ones at the core. We, as a community, recognize the importance of free speech; however, we do not support malicious speech that is solely meant to divide and inflame.

It is our duty, as the individuals of this community, to create a space where differences may not only be tolerated, but celebrated. In an atmosphere such as this, it is up to each and every one of us to make this campus what it is. Although we may come from very different backgrounds, we are all here for a common reason. Our fellow students are not able to be successful if there is a lack of support from peers. We welcome, celebrate, and affirm people of every race, religion, nationality, age, marital status, gender identity, economic status, sexual orientation, and mental or physical ability. No matter the difference, we are all humans, we are all valid, and we all belong.

As a community who believes in the above statement, we do not and will never tolerate transphobia, Islamophobia, homophobia, and the mocking of those who have been sexually assaulted. As a reminder of our values as an institution and community, the Student Code of Conduct states, “The University seeks a community that is free from violence, threats, and intimidation; that is respectful of the rights, opportunities, and welfare of students, faculty, staff, and guests of the University; and that does not threaten the physical or mental health or safety of members of the University community.” Speech and actions that are intended to attack one’s personhood and identity do not fit within our values. These actions threaten the mental health of students and do not comply with our community values. Furthermore, the University of Minnesota Morris community deeply values and holds respect and kindness in high regard. Respect and kindness are what makes this community different and so much better than others. Maliciously asserting that people’s identities do not exist and mocking people who have been hurt are not kind or respectful actions.

We cannot say it any louder. Each and every single individual in our community is valid. Each and every single individual in our community is welcomed here. Each and every single individual in our community belongs here. We all are valid, welcomed here, and belong here no matter our race, religion, color, sex, creed, marital status, public assistance status, political leanings, national origin, disability, age, veteran status, gender identity, or sexual orientation. We are all entitled to love, respect, and kindness. We must first respect the existence and identity of others who may be different than us. We all share humanity. Our institution and community values the freedom of speech as stated in our Student Code of Conduct: “Students are entitled to the rights and responsibilities of other citizens with regard to freedom of speech, peaceable assembly, and right to petition. Students are entitled to exercise their rights to inquire and dissent, speak freely, and peaceably assemble and protest to the extent permissible under both the First Amendment and the Student Conduct Code.” That does not mean, however, our speech is free from consequences. A core guiding principle of the mission of the University of Minnesota and our community is that it “strives to sustain an open exchange of ideas in an environment that...provides an atmosphere of mutual respect, free from racism, sexism, and other forms of prejudice and intolerance.” Freedom of speech applies to all, however, it comes with a responsibility to respect the rights and freedoms of others. Ultimately, we strive for and encourage free, respectful speech that does not negatively harm others.

We must also remember that the University of Minnesota Morris has many resources and kind faculty and staff dedicated to the success of all students, especially those of marginalized communities. Many of these resources come from the Office of Equity, Diversity and Intercultural Programs. This is not to say that we should not do better, because we should, but rather that we do have strong support and resources. This includes many clubs and student organizations as well. The voices of those who are against us, although loud and hurtful, are far fewer than those who are with us. 

Our community through these resources has programming intended to work through differences. Looking at this semester alone, the Muslim Student Association is hosting a community meal tonight at 8 PM at Faith Lutheran Church. October 17th is International Pronouns Day and the Morris Queer Student Initiative for Equality (MoQSIE) has programming planned to celebrate proper pronoun usage, understanding, and acceptance. Trans Day of Remembrance is November 20th and an administrative listening session focused on LGBTQ+ issues has been scheduled. Take advantage of these events to support and gain more understanding of those in our community.

Community members are encouraged to look at and give positive feedback on the new University of Minnesota Gender Identity policy that is currently under review. This new policy aligns with University “commitments to non-discriminatory programs, activities, and facilities, and promotes a respectful University community free from discrimination based on gender identity or expression.”

We call upon all members of our community to act, to empower each other, and to respect each other. We must act in ways that lift up the people that are being harmed rather than focusing on the people doing the harm. We must push for administrative policy changes and more institutionalized programming that support members of marginalized communities. Again, please review and give positive feedback on the linked Gender Identity policy as it will have a great positive impact once finalized. Extreme action is needed, but more importantly, extreme love and respect is needed as well. Much of the divisive rhetoric used is meant to purposefully provoke other members of the community. Although easy, it is not helpful to let your actions be led by anger and frustration. We must be a community where individuals are not only able, but encouraged, to be their true selves without fear of retribution. 

Sincerely,

Your peers, your friends, and allies
