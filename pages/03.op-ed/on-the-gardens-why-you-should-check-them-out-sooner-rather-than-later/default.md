The West Central Research and Outreach Center Horticulture Gardens are just over a mile east of campus off of Highway 329. Each year, the gardens feature thousands of varieties of vegetation, both flowers and edible plants alike. They won’t be there forever, though, so it’s worth it to pop by before the gardens lose their leaves for the winter. 

Near the flagpole are several display gardens for flowers that businesses want trialed or shown off. Some of the plants here and around the garden are not fully released yet, and are being monitored for how well they take to the soil, or how long and how well they flower. During the summer, and in preparation for the annual Horticulture Night, hundreds of hours of weeding a week are needed to keep the gardens looking clean and organized. 

The Meditation Garden is filled with grasses that grow naturally on the prairie. It is one of the newer gardens and features several sculptures and rock formations that might not be immediately visible from outside the gardens due to the tall grasses. 

The Pollinator Garden is the most practical of the gardens. Research students might sit out and watch the flowers there, which are chosen for their ability to draw in pollinators such as bees and many other species of insect. There is a lot we still don’t know about pollinators, and identifying more of them can be a difficult task when your subjects are flying everywhere! 

The Tropical Garden is one of my favorites. It looks as if everything is almost from another planet when you look at its surroundings. There are banana trees, Japanese maple trees, and a koi pond right next door, which is even fed water through a stream that runs from the top of the alcove into the pond. 
Outside of the paths and across the highway, you might catch a glimpse of the New Deer Fence, an area used to trial different varieties of strawberries. Each selection is trialed three times each year, and randomized over the selected plots so that each has an even ability to produce fruit. Many of the berries from these plots actually end up being used by Dining Services. 

While much of the gardens have plants lain down in curved or meshed patterns, the All-American Standard Trial Garden serves a more scientific approach, with each variety planted in a straight, equidistant row so that they have a better representation than might otherwise be achieved. It is always interesting to see which plants perform the best in this climate compared to others considered for the All-American Standard title. 

The Quilt Garden is a longstanding tradition that is made possible with the help of volunteers. It lies next to the house structure, and is always a bed of patterned flowers. The densely-packed petals give off an interesting image of consistent color patterns regardless of the angle at which you are viewing it. 
New to the gardens this year is the kite structure, which provides shade for people on picnics or simply enjoying the scenery alike. The spitting frogs next door also help children learn about renewable energy. 

The Children’s Garden is host to attractions such as a playground structure, ladybug-themed checkers, and a chimney shelter for displaced birds. This section is one of the most interactive of all the gardens, and it’s full of planters with reactive plants and other varieties of vegetation that you might not see elsewhere in Minnesota. 

The gardens won’t look like they do now for long, though. After a frost, things start to wilt, and no effort the gardeners put in can prevent this. It’s definitely worth the time to pop by before everything goes to seed. 

p.s. If you do stop by, try and look for the “Deer like our plants, too!” sign, the Willie’s Bench 4 Arbours/ farmyard animal planters, and “the Pizza Garden!”
