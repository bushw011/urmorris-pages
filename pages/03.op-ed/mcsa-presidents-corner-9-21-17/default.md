Dear campus community,

Greeting to new and old students! As we are now a few weeks into Fall Semester, I hope you all are adjusting well and preparing for the first wave of exams. Your friendly student government, MCSA, has been busy this last month gearing up for the new year. On September 6, we had our Ice Cream Social in Louie’s Lower Level. Lots of students came to eat sundaes, talk campus governance, and shoot some pool with our executive officers. It was exciting to meet so many students that are interested in helping our school run!

MCSA had its first forum on Monday, September 11. Below is a list of notable accomplishments:
•	MCSA welcomed new members and assigned representatives to MCSA Forum and Campus Assembly Committees.  MCSA Forum Committees are open to any student to join. If you would like to join MCSA Forum and serve on either Student Services, Academic Affairs, Campus Relations, and/or Resources and Operations, please come to our next forum on 9/25 at 6 p.m. in the Cow Palace, and speak to one of our executive members. You can join any time of the year—we’d love your help!
•	MCSA informed first-year students of the upcoming First-Year Elections. If you are a first-year student (freshman or transfer) and you would like to be a voting member on MCSA, please submit a statement of purpose and short biography (one blurb total, 300 words max) to our Election Commissionerm Tiernan Lenius, at leniu020@morris.umn.edu. Applications are due 9/22 and the elections will run from 9/27 to 9/29.
•	MCSA approved submitted student organization representative applications. 

If you have any questions/concerns/ideas/compliments, please come to our open forum and tell us! The beginning of every MCSA forum (Mondays, 6 p.m., Cow Palace) is open to the public. If you cannot make it to our forum, that’s okay. We are quick to respond to emails and hold office hours (our office is located across from the Student Activities Office). Email us at ummmcsa@morris.umn.edu or call us at 320-589-6079. 

Below is the list of the office hours of each of our executive officers:
Elsie Wilson, President: F, 1:00-3:00 p.m.
Ruby DeBellis, Vice President: M, 10:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m.
Sara Carmen, Secretary of Academic Affairs: T, 11:00 a.m.-1:00p.m.

Sincerely,

Elsie Wilson,

UMM Student Body President
