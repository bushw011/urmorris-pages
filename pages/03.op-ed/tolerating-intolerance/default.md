A question on my mind as of late pertains to whether it is possible to separate people from other aspects of themselves. Can I still enjoy a Kevin Spacey flick, knowing what I know now? Is it possible for my conservative and religious family members to “love the sinner, hate the sin” when they’re talking about an immutable aspect of my being—my sexual orientation? Is it possible to separate a person from their political beliefs?

Can I be friends with you, who doesn’t believe I have a right to marry who I love? Can I be friends with you, who is willing to elect a pedophile over a proven voice for justice? Can I be friends with you, who refuses to respect the pronouns of my transgender friends?

The answer to all of these questions is, “No. Unequivocally, absolutely not.”

“Wow, that’s kinda harsh,” you may be thinking to yourself while pondering just what might have crawled up my ass and died.

Here’s why I would disagree with that reaction:

You see, the best indicator for a person’s character isn’t how they treat their buddies, but how they treat their “them,” and no, that’s not a typo. I don’t care how you treat fellow white people. I don’t care that you show other men respect. I don’t care how you treat the people you perceive to be straight and/or cisgender. I don’t care how you treat me once I’ve “gotten to know you.” What I care about much more than these things is how you treat minorities—real minorities—who, by definition, lack power in society.

(A quick point on that: until conservatives in this country are five times likelier to be incarcerated than liberals for the same crimes; until conservatives in this country are eight times likelier to commit suicide in high school than their liberal classmates; until conservatives in this country truly experience powerlessness—they are not a real minority.)

But I repeat: how you treat real minorities is what I’m interested in. That, more than anything else, indicates to me how truly good of a person you are. Like, don’t get me wrong, congratu-fuckin-lations that you are decent to people who look and think and act like you, but that’s one of the lowest bars you could possibly set for yourself on the I’m-not-a-prick-o-meter, and quite frankly, it’s not enough. What would be better is if you treated everyone with that same level of respectful with which you treat your friends, so that I might, in return, be able to treat you with respect. Then literally everyone could be happy.
 But, in the meantime, while you’re still using the word “gay” as a put-down, while you’re point-blank refusing to respect my friends’ preferred pronouns, while you’re refusing to let LGBTQIA2S+ students have ONE WEEK of queer pride, while you’re making university students (myself included) feel unsafe for the sole purpose of creating controversy, while you’re keeping intellectual bedfellows with public speakers who have had to say—on multiple occasions—that they’re not white supremacists, while you’re still clinging to the “it’s what’s in your pants” doctrine, while you’re pissing and moaning about people who are exercising their liberty to have neon hair like they’ve thrown your newborn child into oncoming traffic, while your _kampfs_ published on _Breitbart_ are resulting in death threats being sent to my fellow students, while you are doing all of this and much, much more, I can say, definitively, that we can’t be friends, and I can’t be friendly, because none of this is okay. (And no, before _The UR_ gets taken over by a swarm of op-ed submissions in response to that statement, that is not any sort of threat. I really do just mean that I won’t be “kind and pleasant” to you.)

And for anyone reading this who doesn’t condone these actions (all of which have happened on this campus during this semester), but who remains friends with the people committing these actions: I hope you have a good reason for doing so. I hope you stay friendly out of workplace professionalism and not just because it’s easier not to confront people. I hope you stay silent because challenging Uncle Phil at Thanksgiving could mean your parents financially cut you off, and not just because it’s Uncle Phil being Uncle Phil. I hope you tolerate intolerance for a real reason, and not just because you don’t belong to the minority.

Best of luck on finals and happy holidays,

Christian Pfeiffer
