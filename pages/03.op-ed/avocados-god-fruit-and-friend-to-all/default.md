One might say that avocados are to the food world what cats are to the internet. This silky, green fruit is generally accepted to be a multipurpose food of the gods. If I had the expendable income, I am confident that I could find a meaningful and tasteful home for the avocado in every meal I created. Sweet enough for smoothies and desserts, and mild enough for savory delicacies such as guacamole and burgers, the avocado has few true rivals in the world of adaptable foods. Anyone who has tasted my avocado cookies or my spicy black bean burgers with avocado sauce can attest to this indisputable fact of life. Not only does it taste like everything you’ve ever wanted from a food, it is high in potassium, monounsaturated fatty acids, and can lower your cholesterol. Do you really need more reasons to eat avocado? I didn’t think so, but I’ll keep going anyway. 

The avocado is a beautiful thing. Have you ever taken your sharpest knife and cleanly sliced into the rich meaty insides of a perfectly ripe god-fruit? If done correctly, you will be left with two, perfect, oval boats of avocado, one with a large brown seed in the middle. There are few colors more enticing to the human eye than that of this soft, yellow-green flesh. I’m sure any foodies out there wouldn’t hesitate to agree that the avocado is a quick and easy guarantee for a highly-aesthetic Instagram pic. I’m looking at you, avocado toast. 

Speaking of avocado toast, have you had avocado toast? I’m sorry, a more accurate question would be: Have your taste buds lived yet? There are two right answers to the question above: “Yes”, and, “No but I’m headed to Willie’s tomorrow to stop depriving myself of this fine delicacy.” 

Still not convinced? I will go ahead and name just a few foods that are improved upon by the addition of the avocado: macaroni and cheese, all pasta, all types of bread, sandwiches (both vegetarian and otherwise), grilled cheese, other vegetables, chips, crackers, burgers, egg rolls, cookies (when combined into the dough), eggs, oatmeal, brownies, and finally, cheese. Heck, you can even eat it by itself with a dash of salt and a spoon. Honestly, you could try to find a food that doesn’t get along with avocado, but in the end you’ll be forced to admit that avocados are just too darn friendly and have far more friends than you ever will. Don’t take offense to that, I don’t think anyone has more friends than the avocado. 

Many avocados are grown and raised in Southern California, which means they are probably pretty liberal when it comes to politics and opinions. It is very unlikely that an avocado will judge you for your physical appearance or your taste in music. And because it has so many food friends, it is used to being challenged ideologically, and is always game for an open-minded conversation in which both parties listen respectfully and accept each other’s differences of opinions because we all come from unique backgrounds that have influenced us to be who we are today and that is okay. If the avocado decides that you have formed your opinion from trustworthy and intelligent sources, and that you also have a reasonable dose of compassion and humanity, it will be more than happy to evolve its current beliefs to be more educated and thoughtful, and simply asks that you do the same. You can trust an avocado.
