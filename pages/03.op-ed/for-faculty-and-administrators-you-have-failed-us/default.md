**Anonymous Submission** _originally published in Issue 5, Volume 30 of The University Register on Friday, November 17, 2017_

On October 31, 1993, two African American students who were members of the UMM wrestling team were the victims of a malicious “prank.” The two students were riding in a car down Highway 28 with the then-assistant coach of the wrestling team when they were stopped a few miles west of Morris. Five students posing as Ku Klux Klan members stood in front of a burning cross on the highway. One of them wielded a firearm.

The two victims feared for their lives. One of the KKK-dressed students fired the gun up in the air, and the assistant coach fell on the ground acting like he was shot. In a panic, one of the students had taken the coach’s truck to Chokio to call 911. When the police showed up, the perpetrators tried to explain their “prank.”

This incident shook the campus. However, it was the strong leadership from faculty members and Chancellor David C. Johnson that helped UMM move forward from the heinous hate crime. The institution held an open and informal meeting in the Science Auditorium and created a large list of “suggestions for improving the campus climate,” which, according to archived committee meeting drafts and emails, were all considered throughout the healing process. 

Faculty members of color hosted events and processing spaces, and the university began to hire more faculty of color. Chancellor Johnson created an ad hoc committee which sought to improve diversity at UMM, and he did something which most administrations since have failed to do: he talked with students. He regularly sat in the TMC with students, sent emails to all of campus, wrote in the University Register, etc. 

The perpetrators of these events were punished, and the coach resigned.

The UMM community has been ailing since last year. Enrollment is significantly down, UMM is in debt, our campus culture has changed from an open, light-hearted, intellectual, and loving environment to one that is depressed and apathetic. The community bears the frustrating burden of having to combat insensitivity and of having to console friends whose hard-won identities are being questioned at every corner, all while trying to get all your damn homework done at one of the most academically rigorous universities in the state. 

Additionally, the free speech board in Louie’s—once densely populated with surreal dick art, memes, jokes, and other such jollity—now has just one of two phrases scrawled across it whenever it gets cleaned: either “Fuck Fascists” or “Make America Great Again.” It then sits idle until someone draws an announcement on it. The whiteboard wall in the Student Center hasn’t been erased since Orientation Week. 

[The University of MN Morris Forum] explodes once a week with some bigoted post—with someone saying that Native Americans deserved the abuses of our forefathers. Last year, during Coming Out week—a week of pride and of recognition for the queer community—an organization on campus held parody events, culminating to a Heterosexuality Panel which took place after MoQSIE’s Asexuality Panel. 

We suffered emotional abuse on the Listserv. The Listserv, a place for the publication of events and housing, was co-opted by an organization to spread hate of queer people—to tell trans people that they were mentally ill and unfit for society. Our poster spaces were filled up with trash. The space, which is used for event advertising, was co-opted by an organization for a political agenda. They weren’t advertising—they just wanted to tell campus that we were babies for thinking that queer people are real and valid and that maybe our economic system isn’t working for everyone. Just recently, there was even a swastika put up in the Student Center. This is not indicative of a campus that is active and frothing with constructive debate.

We need a leader. There is a huge disconnect between the administration, the faculty, and the students (within which there is a disconnect between students involved in student government and regular students). I haven’t received any email on any of the bias incidents that have occurred in the past two years. I haven’t seen many administrators regularly interacting with students for the past two years. I haven’t seen faculty members get involved in student discussions—whether that be in the TMC, on the Forum (which they should be members of), or in the op-ed pages of _The University Register._

In all honesty, maybe I’m just a grumpy old man—the idealism of my freshman year wore off and now, as a junior, I see UMM for what it is. I don’t get out much anymore, and I used to go to everything and be an officer in everything. However, thinking back to it, the apathy didn’t start to set in until the Heterosexuality Panel—which happened during a confusing time in history. 

UMM’s would-be chancellor was withdrawn, Jackie Johnson (who had hoped to retire) had to come back while the community searched for a new leader.

During this time, students generally felt like the administration wasn’t doing anything—and they were not. It was a time of transition and it is always during those times when kingdoms fall.

I refuse to believe that UMM is a school that allows its students to fall into apathy. On behalf of students at UMM, I implore the administration and faculty to do something more. We can’t allow our (student) ignorance and vile discourse to continue this way much longer for it will be the end of the grand “Morris experiment.” Now more than ever we need someone to pull us from the darkness.
