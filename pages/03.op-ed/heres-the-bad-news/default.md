As of late afternoon on Wednesday, a Biden victory feels pretty inevitable, barring any outlandish brouhaha in the courts. So it is with much relief that we can finally expect that Donald Trump will no longer be our President.

But I won’t lie, I don’t feel particularly great. Not just because I have complicated feelings about Biden and what his election (and the demographics through which he won) means for the trajectory of the Democratic Party, but because, as has been the theme over the last ten years, Democrats have failed to translate a national message into down-ballot success, losing a competitive race for the U.S. Senate for a fourth straight time and yet again failing at the state legislature level. They’ve maybe lost a bit of their margin in the House, too.

Which is, well, it’s bad. By far the biggest point of stress right now is the 6-3 SCOTUS balance, with Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch serving as the swing vote. If any SCOTUS member exits in Biden’s first two years in office, there is significantly less possibility of using that vacancy advantageously. The possibility of answering the RBG-ACB swing (and the Kavanaugh-Gorsuch non-swing) with, say, a liberal Thomas replacement is just impossible now. Satisfactorily replacing Stephen Breyer could prove difficult. And the rest of the judiciary will be tough, too. And it goes without saying that Biden won’t be able to advance any legislation of real note.

Meanwhile, the current Wednesday evening outlook of our state legislature is that it had a similar night to the one it had in 2016. Then, we expected to pick up the State House but instead lost the State Senate; this time we expected to pick up the Senate and instead lost a little ground in the House. Tim Walz and Melissa Hortman will likely govern on the defensive, held accountable to the most worried and moderate members of the caucus. Forget progressive goals like driver’s licenses for all, taxing the wealthy, marijuana legalization (despite South Dakota accomplishing this just fine), and many more. That said, this is still somewhat up in the air as of writing.

Finally, California’s ballot referenda were mostly pretty bleak, most notably with an almost irreversible measure that grants rideshare companies an exemption from having to classify their drivers as employees. The bleakest story in recent American history is the downward trend of the work hours and conditions necessary to meet the cost of living, and this is perhaps the scariest sign that tech companies can just throw money directly into this. We can expect to see battles like this across the country sooner rather than later.

The failure to convert anti-Trump sentiment into a coherent message that benefitted either the down-ticket Democrats or their preferred policy positions (with some exceptions: Florida resoundingly voted to raise its minimum wage and many states voted to relax drug laws) will continue to have devastating effects on Democrats’ ability to counteract the gains that Republicans made while they were in power. We should all be wary of our tendency to hyperfocus on one aspect of a multilayered election.
