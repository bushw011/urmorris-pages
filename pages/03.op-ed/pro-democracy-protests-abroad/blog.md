Over the past few months, Hong Kong and Russia have been entrenched in a series of protests and demonstrations against the anti-democratic status quo in both Russia and China. The half-hearted response by political leaders and violent response by local police in both places has done nothing but inflame the already growing opposition to the established governments in these countries. Responses by some other countries have been a little worrisome to me, but I have hope and believe that there is a good lesson to learn.

The Hong Kong protests, as we should all know by now, began as a direct response to the extradition bill that would have allowed for Hong Kong nationals to be easily extradited to Beijing.

Hong Kong has a history of western ideas enmeshed in its culture and government and saw this to be dangerous to their tradition of due process. This is especially worrisome when you realize that China has a 99.9% conviction rate and capital punishment is used indiscriminately and decided quickly. After the first protests, the
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam – who was already a figure of Beijing establishment – said that the bill is “dead.” The people did not take to this too quickly. The proper legal term is to “withdraw” the bill and the protestors suspected that she would try to pass it quietly after the protests had died down. Because of this blunder by the chief executive, the protests swiftly turned into a widespread objection to China as an establishment in Hong Kong and a call for a more established democracy. The protests began as peaceful with some skirmishes, but the Hong Kong police’s response of tear gas and beatings quickly escalated the situation and further complicated it. Although, interestingly, no clear leader has come forward, the protestors have already gathered five demands which they claim need to be fulfilled or protests will continue indefinitely: 1) the withdrawal of the extradition bill, 2) the resignation of Carrie Lam, 3) an independent inquiry on police brutality during the protests, 4) the release of those arrested, and 5) an assurance that more democratic freedoms be entertained in Hong Kong. Furthermore, although not a general demand, some parts of the protests have also proposed that the characterization of the protests in mainstream media as “riots” be completely redacted. The withdrawal of the bill has finally been conceded by Lam who has also admitted that she would wish to resign, but is unable to. Many think it is too late for just the
withdrawal of the bill to be enough for the protestors. As it stands now, there is no sign of the situation slowing down. 

Although lesser known and considerably underreported, some of the biggest pro-democracy protests since 2012 have erupted in Moscow. During the summer, demonstrators gathered over the quashing of political opponents to the ruling party of Russia in Moscow. The protests were immediately answered with police brutality, suppression of free speech, and thousands of arrests rather than a slow escalation as it was in Hong Kong. A Russian political analyst from the Carnegie Moscow Center, Alexander Baunov believes that this has already transformed into a response to the political machine of the Kremlin as a whole and not just to the municipal governments in Moscow.

I believe these to be not just your run-of-the-mill protests against a government around the world, I see a pattern. The people in these countries are tired of the corruption and failures of their government and would like to see some real rights and freedoms. There were even reports that some of the Hong Kong protestors were using the United States flag during some of the demonstrations. Additionally, there also been a direct call to President Trump and the Congress to act in favor of Hong Kong by the protestors which adds an interesting twist to the already complicated relationship between the Washington and the Beijing regime. This is something we need to take a lesson from: the United States is by far the most free country in the world and we need to use those freedoms given to us by our Constitution to our advantage to civilly discuss the issues in our country because not everyone gets the chance. Let us acknowledge the privilege we have in this country, but also stand in unity with those protestors from others.
