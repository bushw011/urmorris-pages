I think someone with more energy than me needs to petition the appropriate offices at UMM to keep the Mall flag at half-staff for no fewer than fifty-eight days: one day for every life lost in the Las Vegas Strip shooting last Sunday evening. Then, when another mass shooting inevitably occurs in the U.S. before these fifty-eight days have passed, we add the number of lives taken in this one to the number of days remaining from the former.

I think we need to be reminded daily of what happens when leaders of the “greatest country in the world” refuse _even just to talk_ about gun control after a man with more than twenty firearms stockpiled in his hotel room commits the worst mass shooting in American history since the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890. I think it’s a slap in the face to the victims of the Las Vegas Strip shooting that, rather than getting some bipartisan gun control talk, we instead get Republican fuck, Senator John Thune of South Dakota, telling us it’s our responsibility to take precautions to not get shot during a mass shooting. I think it is a CRYING-ASS SHAME that, in the wake of a shooting that injured 500 people, there are members of Congress trying to pass an act meant to make three things easier: buying silencers, buying armor-piercing bullets, and moving firearms across state lines.

I think that while it may not be “the” solution (singular), our next move is clear. If we can recognize the lethal capability of something such as an automobile, then we can recognize the lethal capability of a MACHINE THAT WAS EXPRESSLY DESIGNED TO KILL THINGS. The idea that only one of these two things currently requires a license to operate in the U.S., AND IT’S NOT THE THING THAT TODDLERS USED TO KILL _TWENTY-THREE AMERICANS LAST YEAR_, is honestly beyond me. 

And yes, for the love of God, I am aware that the right to bear arms is an inalienable one, bestowed upon all U.S. citizens by the Constitution, but that doesn’t stop us from confiscating firearms from felons and people who have been committed to psychiatric hospitals. It also doesn’t stop us from prohibiting drug addicts, the dishonorably discharged from the military, or those who have been convicted of a misdemeanor for domestic violence from buying guns. Therefore, I ask you, will it really be some extra regulations meant to keep us all safer that end up infringing upon your Second Amendment rights? Is it really asking too much to want potential gun owners to have to submit to a psychiatric evaluation, a waiting period, a background check, and a gun safety class before they’re allowed to purchase something that could be used to rob a mother of her child in less than a second? I really don’t think so, and yet, here we are.

I mean, yes, you could certainly argue that any step at regulating guns is another step toward banning guns completely, but I’ve gotta tell ya, I’ve never been too impressed by slippery slope arguments. I remember when Minnesota was first voting on marriage equality, and a high school classmate of mine delivered a persuasive speech against gay marriage in our public speaking class. Once you got past her singular source, _The Holy Bible_, her arguments against marriage equality were based solely upon conjecture. She argued I should never be allowed to marry a man I’m madly in love with, because I’d be “paving the way for other deviants to marry animals and inanimate objects.” She may as well have pressed two halves of a still-steaming pile of cow shit into my ears. 

Now don’t get me wrong; I like guns. I’m learning how to trap shoot, I was brought up around avid hunters, and I very much respect the role of firearms in Americana. With all of that being said, I am sick and tired of seeing my American siblings on the news, getting murdered in droves, only for the U.S. government—whose job it is to protect them—to offer victims only three things: thoughts, prayers, and the advice to get smaller.

I’m heartbroken.
