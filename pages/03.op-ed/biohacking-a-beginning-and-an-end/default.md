Biohacking is possibly the most interesting thing to come out of DIY “science” this decade. Science, in this case, is in quotations largely due to its disorganized nature. Biohacking does not have an environment of rigorous testing and trials that one might find at most universities or laboratories. Instead, biohackers opt to test their own potentially dangerous cures on themselves rather than wait for the trialing of modern science.

Naturally, this method of testing might result in a lot of unsavory results. Ron Shigeta, a prominent biohacker, says that part of the idea of biohacking is “the ability to just follow [one’s] curiosity — where it should go — and really get to the bottom of something [one wants] to understand” (PBS). This might seem very altruistic and educational, but at the same time there are also many potential risks associated with this new form of experimentation that must also be taken into account.

Biohacking also exists in a grey area of experimentation as it is the decision of the experimenter to attempt to change their own body. It is not completely certain whether it is the best for themselves or those around them. At the moment, it seems as if the main qualifications of biohacking are that the materials used do not break other previously founded laws, but biohacking is becoming increasingly important to government agencies and implicating both sides in an ethical dilemma.
One potential ethical pitfall of this new practice is that government agencies might be able to use the results of such experiments, where there are few regulations and even fewer limitations, and reap the benefits in the form of data without using proper channels or ethics.

Ethics in experimentation have been around for a long time. In this instance, the best example would probably be the Tuskegee experiment in which the U.S. government monitored syphilis patients. During the experiment, a treatment for syphilis was found, but the government decided to continue with their experiment anyway, leading to avoidable and inhumane experiment (Nix, Elizabeth). Though the biohacking movement is certainly not as terrible as the Tuskegee experiment and the government would not be conducting the experiment by taking data from biohackers. However, it would be a situation similar to giving the biohackers needles, giving them the opportunity to infect themselves, and letting them collect the data themselves before stepping in to find out what exactly has happened. It is unethical, but with more voluntary steps.

Further implications are found in potential risks for those not involved. A BBC article in 2013 raised concerns that biohackers might unintentionally stumble upon a biological weapon or cause an act of bioterrorism by experimenting in home labs. However, a virologist was quick to point out that there are other methods of causing biological havoc that are much easier to attain, such as anthrax (Hanno Charisius). Thus far, the BBC article is quick to point out, there has been no evidence of biohackers intentionally creating weapons and the like or even breaking the law (Hanno Charisius).

Other veins of personal modification are becoming normal worldwide as well, though they are less scientifically based than biohacking and more cosmetic. A New Jersey tattoo artist inserted four magnets into his arm in order to hold an iPod Nano before the reveal of the iWatch (Meghan Neal). This allowed him to carry the ipod with him nearly everywhere and detach it at will. However, other piercing enthusiasts were quick to point out that the piercings would be quickly susceptible to infection, as they will be pushed, pulled, and subjected to frequent movement. In addition, the location of the piercings were unusual, sitting straight on the man’s wrist.

Similar veins of modification for those slightly more faint of heart include implanting magnets within other body parts such as the fingers. Users of this procedure have reported feeling magnetic fields, other metallic objects, and other signals in the world around them (Alexis Madrigal). However, the charges of these magnets do not last forever. Further, once their charge is lost, these magnets are impossible to replace due to the scar tissue formed on one’s fingers after implantation.

Though biohacking can be explicitly dangerous, it might lead researchers to stumble upon something big or widely applicable. This is what the thousands of biohackers worldwide are looking for. Maybe it’s even attainable.
