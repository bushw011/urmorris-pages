Maybe coming to college has made you care more about the environment or maybe red meat gives you gas- either way, you’re looking at cutting some meat and dairy from your life. But how do we do that here in the middle of somewhere? Here are some tips from someone who has been through the gauntlet. Here’s the tips, the deals, the hints, the secrets, and the honest truths. 

**Don’t go into veganism expecting to eat the same meals you ate before. **

Is your go-to meal a grilled cheese? Not anymore. If most of your dinners are a 5 ounce burger patty or a chicken breast with some veggies on the side? Try again. Vegan meat and cheese replacements are expensive and honestly don’t taste like meat or cheese. Your go-to meals will need a complete overhaul.

**Know when to buy fresh vs canned vs dried** 

A great source of protein is beans- but canned beans can be expensive and that adds up. Buying dried beans (prepackaged at Willie’s or in bulk at Pomme de Terre) is way cheaper, and so worth the extra 2 hours of effort. Frozen corn and broccoli are just as good as fresh and way better than canned. The Morris farmer’s market is THE BEST way to get your veggie fill. 

**Explore your stores.**

Did you know ‘I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter’ makes a vegan margarine? Neither did I until buying dairy butter for a friend and seeing it hiding right along with the other margarine. Not every vegan item will be in its own section. Dried beans are on the very bottom shelf. Take the time to really look at every item on each shelf in every aisle.

**Read the ingredients**

Original Oreos are vegan. So are Fritos. Most chocolate has milk. ‘Lactose free’ and ‘Dairy free’ are not synonyms. ALWAYS read the ingredients. Just because something isn’t advertised as vegan doesn’t mean it has meat or eggs or dairy. Just because something is marked as all-natural or healthy doesn’t mean it is vegan. 

**Get to know the staff**

This applies to the dining hall, the TMC, Willie’s, PDT, and basically anywhere. If they know you can’t have meat, they’ll make sure there’s an option for you. Store employees will help you find the hiding items, and if you ask nicely, they might stock a specific product you’re looking for. 

**Don’t be a jerk.** 

Veganism isn’t for everyone. This is your decision, your life. If you enjoy it and share your favorite dinner with friends and they want to try for themselves, that’s cool. But no one wants to hear you talk about how cool you are for not eating cows. Being able to go meatless is a privilege- it requires time, money, and food security. Also some people like meat. It’s their life, yo.
