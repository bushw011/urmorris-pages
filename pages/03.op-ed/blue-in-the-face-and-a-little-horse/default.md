Horses are evil. I said it, and I’ll say it again. Horses. Are. Evil.

I mean, think about it. We used to have a use for horses. They moved carts and carriages and were the fastest and most efficient mode of transportation for thousands of years. Then the industrial revolution hit and horses lost their place in society. This sounds like a bad super villain backstory and it really is. A once-useful animal wandering the world without a purpose. I mean, even just looking at them they’re creepy. With their too-skinny legs struggling to support their massive bodies. Their oddly human like hair, just too glossy and too shiny. Their soulless black eyes staring into your soul as their teeth gnash together, staring you down. They own you. They could destroy you with a single move. 

Everyone knew the horse girl growing up. There’s one in every school, that girl who just loves horses. Horse binders, horse clothing, horse books, horse media. Horses control these girls, using them as slaves to their dark agenda, to keep themselves relevant in this world. We all knew a horse girl. But did any of us really KNOW the horse girl? Look at horse-related movies. Horse meets girl. They form a codependent relationship. The girl protects the horse from the world and in return the horse wins a race—or whatever it is that horses do.

Horses need these puppets in the world, and use their dark energies in order to persist in this age of steam and motors. Do not trust the horses. Think about it. Would you trust a horse with your life? There are so many better animals. Goats are pretty great. So are deer. You don’t need the watchful eyes of a horse staring you down as you just try to live your life. In these trying times, it often seems like it is the end. Any day now the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse might come to bring their wrath upon us. But perhaps we should not be worried about the horseman, but rather the horse he rode in on.
