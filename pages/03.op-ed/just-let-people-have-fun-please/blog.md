In all honesty, I am terrible at keeping up with current events despite my presence on social media. Maybe I’m four steps behind everyone else, but I have only just heard about the interview of Billie Eilish in which she was teased for not knowing about Van Halen, and I really don’t think I could be less interested or amused. This disinterest is not directed at Billie Eilish, just to clarify; though I don’t listen to her music, I understand that she’s very talented and successful. What I am bored of is the trend of middle-aged men embodying the spirit of “Oh, you like this band? Name 10 of their songs RIGHT NOW.” Shaming others for not being experts on something you love isn’t the peak of comedy, especially when those you are shaming are children.

To quote some stranger on Twitter, “Ah yes, let’s shit on Billie Eilish for not knowing Van Halen, a band that has not been remotely relevant the last 30 years.” Now, I don’t really care if you like Billie or Van Halen (or both or neither), but I simply don’t understand why we’re supposed to find this funny. Regardless of whether a 17-year-old truthfully does not know a certain band or not, I believe that we should simply let people have fun.

When I say that we should simply let people have fun, I am arguing that everybody can have different levels of depth and attachment to their interests. I for one am frighteningly obsessed with my favorite musicians and could tell you unimportant little details about Elton John’s hobbies or Tom Waits’ obscure interviews, but I would never shame another person for not sharing this knowledge. We can’t all have Elton John tattoos, right?

This weird and uncomfortable gatekeeping of popular media that seems to keep happening is terribly boring to me. I get it, alright? I know that these guys are sick of hearing “ok, boomer” or whatever it is this time that is pissing off these well-off men over the age of 40. Though I don’t feel the same way, I can comprehend at a very basic level where this behavior comes from.

That being said, everyone is entitled to their own interests as long as those interests are not harming others. This is especially true in the case of music, TV, and other media. Media is pretty damn accessible to most people. Almost everyone listens to and enjoys music, but everyone’s tastes are different, and there’s no good reason to be an asshole about that.

Perhaps you are someone who likes to interrogate others about their likes and dislikes. Maybe you have at one point said, “You like TV? Name every show.” (Okay, none of us have gone that far, but you all know what I mean.) Here is my friendly recommendation for you: get a hobby! Find some mundane activity that you can be comfortably mediocre at! Let others do the same! I think you’ll find that life becomes more enjoyable and less stressful when you can coast by, moving day-to-day through the activities that you can complete but aren’t quite able to brag about.

All jokes aside, I stand by my disinterest in making fun of teenagers for not knowing the media of previous generations. Don’t be the guy who makes others feel bad for having fun and enjoying the things that make them happy. Nobody likes that guy, and there are so many better uses of your time. There are other jokes to make and other ways to lift yourself higher without pushing others down. Let others have fun please.
