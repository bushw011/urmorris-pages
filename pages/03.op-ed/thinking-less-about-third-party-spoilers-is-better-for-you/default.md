Every presidential election cycle I see much tut-tutting, usually from wonk-aspiring liberals, about the spoiler effect. Particularly after the razor thin margin in Florida in 2000, a great interest was taken in the notion that if only these third party candidates would stay off the ballot, the outcomes of our elections would be purer and better. Then it roared back again after 2016, when Trump’s Rust Belt pickups were all won by less than Jill Stein’s vote totals in those states. Surely, the logic goes, all of these Jill Stein votes would deservingly have gone to Hillary Clinton.

I completely get that impulse. The spoiler effect is this big, sexy thing we can point to and use to rationalize away a loss, imagining that fixing it is the path of least 
resistance to a preferred outcome.

And, well, maybe. I find the logic a little spurious, but let’s take that to its logical conclusion and then ask the question of what is to be done. Occasionally, the Green Party’s place on a state’s ballot becomes a partisan issue that’s sent through the courts – in fact, the Green Party is not on the ballot in the all-important Pennsylvania – but I imagine that efforts to genuinely keep third parties off the tickets is not actually what most people want.

So there are two other options. The first is to ensure your candidate wins so convincingly that spoiler effects can’t possibly matter. The second is to undertake the extraordinary work of minimizing third party votes. And so, people spend hours on Facebook debating friends of friends on Facebook about whether acquiescing to the two party system for just one day is a moral imperative or not.

I’ve dabbled in political organizing for the last four years, and there are really two things a campaign can do with voters: earn their votes, or try to win without them. A campaign feeling they deserve someone’s vote is a loser mentality. It definitely makes a certain amount of sense to chase after people who are already civically engaged enough to vote but too alienated to gravitate towards a major candidate.

But a problem arises when we get too stuck on one group of voters. Sure, absolutely have conversations with your family and close friends, people who really value your take on these things, but I think too often we get hung up on third party voters who “cause” an undesirable outcome than the people who actually vote for that undesirable outcome. 

Especially in a two party system that many Americans don’t feel represented by, some number of third party votes is just a law of nature. Earnestly try to earn those votes or simply move on to the next voter engagement. I’m absolutely not advocating that anyone reading this article vote for Howie Hawkins or whoever, and I’m certainly not suggesting that we hold no responsibility for our votes. But if everyone arguing about third parties hopped on the dialer for a few minutes instead, we’d likely have a better, more civically-engaged country.
