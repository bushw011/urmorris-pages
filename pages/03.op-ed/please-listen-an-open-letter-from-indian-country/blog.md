**By Dylan Young, Staff Writer** _Originally published in Issue 8, Volume 32 of The University Register on Friday, February 7, 2020_

Being an indigenous person in the United States of America is not all free tuition and gaming revenue. In the rare moments that we are not subjected to racism, mockery, and genocide, we are disregarded by society and our place in American history is quietly tucked underneath stories of patriotic grandeur and idealism. 

Even during my education back home on the reservation, where the student body was entirely Native American, was I seldom taught about the darker sides of America’s foundation, or the history and culture of our own people. Even in the present, the times which are yet to be recorded in history books, are Native Americans represented. This disregard exists, even here on campus, where NativeAmerican people represent 25% of the student body. Ask yourself this: How many times during your application process or during your orientation was the history of this university expound upon? How long was it before you realized what the building that is now the Multi-Ethnic Resource Center once was? Do you truly understand why the tuition waiver exists?

The dismissal of Native American people is why any significant acknowledgement of us catches my interest, and probably why I am writing an entire article over a tweet. This tweet can be looked upon from several angles; one could observe how this is one of the only times Donald Trump has treated Native American people with respect, and how conveniently close to his re-election bid it came. One could talk about how Trump’s admiration for Native American people is a farce, as proven by one of his first presidential acts was signing an executive order to continue the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a slap in the face to water protectors and indigenous people across the nation. But exploring either of those ideas is unnecessary, as those who would understand already do, and those who would not, would never. Instead, the part of the tweet that drew my interest the most was the ensuing reactions and outrage from liberal and left-leaning Twitter users, who condemned the tweet as racist because of the usage of the outdated terminology “Indian Country,” to describe America’s indigenous population.

There was, however, one issue with the critique: Indian country is not an inherently racist term. As a matter of fact, one of the most prominent Native American-ran news platforms in the country is named Indian Country Today. Many conservatives and liberals on the platform who were aware of the harmlessness of the term further contributed to the ignorance, citing the legal usage of “Indian Country” in Bureau of Indian Affairs documents, rather than actual Native American people, to prove the innocence of the term; I have never met a Native American in my life who considered the BIA, or any federal entity for that matter, as the authority of what is right and wrong when dealing with indigenous matters. 

This incident served as a reminder of something I have always been aware of: Indigenous voices are not listened to. Even the Democratic Party, an institution that has created a brand of equality and inclusiveness, is willing to let our voices be muted if it means they are able to berate the president for being racist (a fact that remains true even despite his correct usage of Indian country). With candidates such as Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren in the running for the democratic candidacy in the upcoming presidential election, it is evident that for all of the talk of civil rights within their platform, the Democratic Party still has an issue with taking into account perspectives that are not white and middle class, much less indigenous.
