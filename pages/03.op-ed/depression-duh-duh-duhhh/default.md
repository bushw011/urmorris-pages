If you don’t like Christian “Get off my lawn!” Pfeiffer, aka Christian “Andy Rooney, back from the dead and stronger than ever” Pfeiffer, aka Christian "angry growls" Pfeiffer, now is your chance to back out. You have been warned.

If you’ve ever taken a class with UMM Concert Choir Director, Bradley Miller, you may have heard him use the phrase “it’s not your fault, but it _is_ your problem.” That’s depression in a nutshell. If you suffer from it, you know that you’ve done nothing to earn it. Or, at least, I hope you do; I would feel really bad if you think you have it as divine punishment for touching yourself at night. But I digress. The point is having depression is not your fault.

However, it’s the second half of my argument, dear reader, that I’d like to focus on. The simple truth of the matter is that while depression IS NOT your fault, it _is_ your problem. In other words, ultimately, it is up to _you_ to make good choices for yourself. 

Now I’m not saying that if you suffer from depression, it’s your duty to fight the illness alone because that would be bonkers. Everyone needs a support network. But, in the same way you can lead a horse to its therapy sessions, you can’t make the horse follow its therapist’s recommendations if it doesn’t want to. Ultimately, it’s up to the horse to make the conscious and resolute decision that it is sick and tired of feeling sick and tired, and subsequently decide that it is going to do everything in its power to get better.

This is what it means to be an adult. Adults take responsibility for their mental health and are proactive. They engage in activities they know will likely cheer them up and avoid those activities they know will likely bring them down. They eat healthy and get a good night’s rest before Monday morning and don’t treat their bodies like Darla treats the fish in _Finding Nemo_. They do this because they are serious about their passions.

Children make excuses. They say they care about what they’re doing, that they’re passionate about learning, and that they’re sorry they’ve missed class again, but they don’t take any steps toward improving themselves, their situations, or their mental health. Rather, they embody Einstein’s definition of insanity by repeating those behaviors which clearly aren’t working for them and expecting that next week, after a weekend of moping, staying up late, and not doing their homework, that somehow they’ll magically stop wanting to die.

Now at this point, you’re probably asking yourself why I have such stern words for people with depression. The reason I have written the semi-ableist, half-tour-de-force, half-manifesto before you is that I, as someone who has struggled with situational and clinical depression since he knew the difference between the two, am tired of people normalizing the idea that depression is this insurmountable Goliath who always has, and always will knock the piss out of you—even when you’re already down—and that there’s nothing you can do about it. I am the first to grant you that there are times this feels like an unshakable truth, but I am also the first to guarantee you it’s not, IF you’re serious about wanting to feel better.

In short, if you can’t perform the most basic act of good faith in your $18k/year investment, eg. showing up to classes, maybe it’s just not in your best interest to be in college right now. And if you _can_ show up to class, maybe you just should.

I really am saying this with love,
