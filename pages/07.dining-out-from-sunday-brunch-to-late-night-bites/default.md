Dining out is a quintessential college experience for newcomers who have yet to try the local fare. For those with pocket change to spare, it can be a nice change from the everyday dining hall food. While the in-person dining experience looks a bit different with COVID-19 regulations in place, the dining out culture continues to thrive and change. Many eateries are now offering options such as curbside pickup and outdoor dining as well as delivery. Since coming back to campus this fall, I have eaten at (or ordered online from) several different dining establishments around town and seen some of these changes for myself. Here are some Morris restaurants that have changed their methods of ordering and eating (for better or for worse) to ensure a safe dining experience for all:

**Mi Mexico**

This lively Mexican restaurant with a great atmosphere is offering takeout and dine-in options with spaced-out seating. The wait time can be a bit long — at least compared to fast food alternatives — but the food is worth the wait. While some of the menu is in a higher price range, there are certainly affordable options to be found.

_Angelica recommends: horchata (a delicious cinnamon beverage made from rice and milk), the bean and cheese burrito, and fried ice cream._

**Pizza Hut**

It is not exactly gourmet, yet Pizza Hut continues to be a classic for weekends and those late nights spent studying. They have dine-in, takeout, and delivery options including the addition of no-contact delivery and takeout. If no-contact is chosen, the driver/employee will leave your order either in front of your hall/apartment block door or on top of your car if it is takeout. The employee will then wait to ensure that you have received your order. The wait time is 30-45 minutes and it can be pricey for a college student on a budget.

_Angelica recommends: cheese and red onion pizza (trust me, it’s good), Cinnabon mini rolls, and quepapas (similar to tater tots with cheese and jalapeño inside)._

**Stone’s Throw Cafe**

The Stone’s Throw Cafe, an upscale dining establishment with a casual feel to it, is newer to the Morris community. They are a popular venue for events, and they have been hosting their own events such as trivia nights for the past few years. They currently offer takeout (no online ordering, call-in only), curbside pickup, and dine-in with outdoor seating options. The food is expensive for a college budget, but certainly worth the money for how high-quality it is. 

_Angelica recommends: tempura vegetables (I cannot stress enough how good these are), Stone’s Throw onion rings, penne alfredo, and the flourless chocolate torte._

**Don’s Cafe**

Don’s is a diner-style restaurant known for their shakes and classic diner fare. They are open for dine-in and takeout options. The price range is moderate and the wait time is about 15-20 minutes. They are often busier on weekends, so expect a bit of a wait if you are dining in.

_Angelica recommends: Oreo and peanut butter cup shake, grilled cheese, and curly fries._

**China Panda**

China Panda serves a variety of Chinese dishes with the only option currently being take-out. They have been taking COVID-19 safety precautions very seriously; they have clear tarps blocking the majority of the restaurant space and plastic dividers in the main waiting room for food pickup. The wait time is longer and everything is moderately priced but it is worth it for the food.

_Angelica recommends: cream cheese wontons, fried sugar biscuits, and vegetable lo mein_

**McDonald’s**

McDonald’s, a fast food staple, can be found almost anywhere in the US. There is something about late-night McDonald’s runs with friends that makes for a quality experience over some tasty fries and burgers. The food is inexpensive, greasy, and the wait time is almost non-existent. This is a very affordable option for any student short on time and/or funds. Ordering options include: drive-thru, take-out, and curbside service when ordering from the McDonald’s app.

_Angelica recommends: Reese’s McFlurry (with caramel added in), apple pies, chocolate chip cookie tote, and fries._
