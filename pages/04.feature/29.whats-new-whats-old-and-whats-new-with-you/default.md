Well, here we are. 2020. We are all mostly not dead (mostly, emphasis definitely on the mostly). Many of us are returning to campus for yet another semester (some of us for our last semester ;_;) and some are arriving here for the first time. Despite being gone for only a month, things have certainly gotten spicy around here on our little campus on the prairie. I  figured, hey, how about I show you guys what is new, what is old that you might have missed, and what is coming up in the coming months. I hope you brought a writing utensil, because I forgot, can I borrow yours?

**The Tunnels (Now Blue and Free of Ads)**

If you are a hip and/or savvy person, you might remember the tunnels, located between the Student Center and the oh-so-scenic Science Building. Last semester, the walls were riddled with advertisements, posters, events, and most importantly, enough paper to cut down a small forest. Over break, staff have finally purged the tunnels of all posters, so now you may admire it for its new (and blue) look. I have to say, it is almost....freaky, how strange and blank the walls look now. I am not sure what they are planning on doing with them now, but I cannot wait to see the results. Maybe we will see some cool artwork? Maybe posters will, in fact, make a return? Or maybe they will simply stay blue. Either way...blue tunnels.

**The Dining Hall (Two, Electric Boogaloo)**

For many of us (including me, #dininghallgang), the dining hall is a place to eat food, relax, and find the few other friends you and I may have on campus. The dining hall, however, has been really stepping up their game this semester. Granted, it has only been two and a half weeks, but their offerings have genuinely improved. That, or my standards have gone down, though considering over break I ate mostly fried food and soup, I doubt that. They are also planning on doing way more events this semester, including giveaways and a movie night, which both occured in January. Also, low key, shout out to Jean the Pizza Queen. We love you. Also, if you pick up your copy of the University Register at the dining hall, you are officially a member of the #dininghallgang. If you tweet out #dininghallgang I will favorite it and you will get brownie points that you can cash in for one (1) funny tweet.

**Bingo (and, of course, Bongo)**

Do you like playing bingo? I know, literally sitting in a room and randomly being given the correct set of numbers to—wait, I won. I WON. Bingo nights are the second Tuesday of every month hosted by the Campus Activities Council (CAC) and one other club. The featured clubs this month are Sigma Tau Delta/English Club (February 11), Korean Culture Club (March 10), and Vamos Juntos (April 14). There are prizes to be won, fun to be had, and food to be eaten because, oh yeah, it’s at the Turtle Mountain Cafe.

**Paint, Sip, and Mental Health**

Back by popular demand, Paint, Sip, and Mental Health, hosted by NASS, is a great way to unwind, participate in guided painting, and relax. Hosted on the first Tuesday of every month in the Alumni Room in Oyate, this is a great way to spend an evening. The event usually has someone lead the painting and participants can either follow the guide or paint on their own. The hosts also have questions that a group can go through about mental health and self care. During this week’s session on February 3, 2020, participants went through a brief meditation session before beginning.

**New Policy: Equity and Access**

On December 11, 2019, the U of M system officially implemented a new policy on gender identity, expression, names, and pronouns. According to the official FAQ on the university’s website, “Using the specified names, pronouns and other gendered personal references of others conveys a basic level of respect for them and their identities. Some individuals do not identify their gender within the binary system assumed by many languages. For example, not every individual identifies as a man or a woman or uses pronouns like he/him/his or she/her/hers. They/them/theirs might be their pronouns. Regardless of how someone identifies, it is important to acknowledge, respect, and refer to them by their specified name and pronouns.” U of M Morris’ work towards assisting and respecting its members of the LGBTQ+ community reflects positively on these new policies.

**Keep Your Eyes Peeled!**

Morris, in general, almost always has something going on, whether it is in town or on campus. Many of the local bars and restaurants around town (including Stone’s Throw and The Met) have started trivia nights, so you can bring your friends down and start quizzing! John’s Total Entertainment is hosting game sessions for Magic, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and D&D on weeknights! The Morris Theatre’s shows are constantly changing (and might even be free for students on certain nights, eye emoji indeed).
