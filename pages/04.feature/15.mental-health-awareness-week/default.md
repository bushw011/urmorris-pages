This past week was Mental Health Awareness week, and the university’s Wellness Center hosted a spread of events dedi- cated to destigmatizing mental illness, providing aid to stu- dents, and spreading awareness about the difficulties faced by those who are mentally ill. These events ranged from awareness panels to meetings with the therapy dogs (Hank and Mercer!) that frequently visit campus. Event attendees also had a chance to meet some of the Peer Health Educators.

Mental health is something that affects many people in the world, particularly undergraduate students dealing with in- tense courses, debt-loads, and major life changes. The men- tal well-being of the students at Morris is something our university takes very seriously, and there are many resourc- es available to students in need of assistance. UMM offers free student counseling services for any student in need. If you feel like you’re struggling, drowning in stress, or just need someone to vent to a bit, please reach out for help.

Mental Health Awareness Week may be over, but it’s still important to take care of yourself, so here’s a collection of resources available to all students.
UMM Student Counseling is avail- able to help you out. Schedule an ap- pointment with them via phone or email. Phone: (320) 589-6060

If you are not in crisis, and don’t want to meet with someone in person or talk with them on the phone, text “UMN” to 61222. It’s a free counseling service of- fered through the university that hap- pens all over text, which works great if talking on the phone gives you anxiety.

If you are in a non-life-threaten- ing crisis and need to talk with someone, call 1-800-273-TALK.

If you are in a dangerous crisis situation, CALL 911!
