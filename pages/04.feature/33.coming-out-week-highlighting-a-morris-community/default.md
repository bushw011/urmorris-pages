October 5-11 is Coming Out Week for the University 0f Minnesota Morris and there are several events being put on by MoQSIE (Morris Queer Student Initiative for Equality) throughout the week.

“National Coming Out Day 2020 is on Sunday October 11th, and to celebrate our LGBTQIA2S+ Community and educate our campus community as a whole we put on a week of different events to make Coming Out Week! We will do a mix of events that are fun activities and then also educational conversations so we can celebrate and educate with our Morris community,” said Sloane Mordecai, Co-chair of MoQSIE.

Chalk Art: “Sidewalk Chalk Art! We decorated the sidewalk in front of the MRC with chalk art to advertise our events for the week and show our pride!”

Zine in One Night: “Tuesday we hosted a One Night Zine event! We had members come together and send various types of media such as drawings, prose/poems, spoken words, and other types of art all in one night which will be compiled together to create our Coming Out Week Zine which will be released on Sunday!”

Inter-generational Lunch Hour: “Wednesday we had our Intergenerational Coffee Chat where we had Morris queer alumni, faculty, current students, and community members of all ages come together and have a virtual chat about how our experiences with coming out and being in the LGBTQIA2S+ community may vary or be similar between the generations.”

Allies & Questioning Panel: “A virtual panel where those who are looking to be better allies or folx wanting to ask questions about their identity and place in the LGBTQIA2S+ Community can talk to our panel of Morris Queer Community Members.”

Movie on the Mall: “Saturday we will be having a Queer Movie on the Mall starting at 8 p.m. where we will be showing Birds of Prey!”

Coming Out Conversations: “Sunday, which is National Coming Out Day, at 3 p.m. we will be hosting Coming Out Conversations via Zoom. We have this event as our finale so we can come together to talk about experiences with coming out and the fears that come with that as well as what makes us feel proud to be a part of this community.
