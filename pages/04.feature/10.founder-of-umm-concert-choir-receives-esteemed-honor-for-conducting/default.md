Professor emeritus and former UMM Concert Choir director Ken Hodgson was awarded the F. Melius Christiansen Lifetime Achievement Award by the American Choral Directors Association of Minnesota. This award, established in 1973, is the highest honor one can receive from the ACDA of Minnesota, and is awarded to individuals with lifelong conducting experience who provide great contributions and amazing service to the choral music of Minnesota, as well as accomplish noteworthy tasks worthy of the name “F. Melius Christiansen,” who founded the St. Olaf Choir. During last weekend’s homecoming concert, current director of the Concert Choir, Dr. Bradley Miller, recognized Ken Hodgson for this grand achievement, who was applauded by the packed recital hall of concert-goers and performers alike.
