Speaking from my experience as a freshman, transitioning from high school to college life can be a daily fluctuation from excitement to terror. Orientation groups seek to provide a smoother transition for many students during this period.

Freshman Rachel Stai found that it was helpful to form connections with her orientation group leader (OGL) and within her orientation group.

“It was really nice to have somebody that was there for you,” she said.  “[My OGL] gave us all her phone number and told us to text her if we had any questions throughout the year.”

Stai also found comfort in how connected her OGL was to the group.

“It seemed like, to Bailey, being an OGL wasn’t just a job or something she had to do.  She went out of her way to make us feel welcome and at home,” said Stai.

Freshman Jeff Langley was in the same OGL group that Stai was, and the experience helped him to become more acquainted with the campus. 

“The good impressions were the warm feeling of campus and everyone being nice,” Langman said.  “The one thing that was bad was that I got a little overwhelmed [remembering] all the names of buildings and where everything was.”

By the time orientation groups had their last meetings, Langman had a better understanding of the campus, and he had formed connections within his orientation group as well.

“We played a lot of games to get to know each other.  Making friends on campus was a big help,” he said.

The name games weren’t for everyone, however.

“[I didn’t like] the name games, [but I liked] the events where everyone was included,” said freshman Jake George.

Another freshman who benefitted from her orientation group was Sarah Hill.

“[My orientation group] helped me learn how to buy books in the bookstore and the library orientation helped me figure out how to check out books,” she said.

Even though orientation is over, OGLs still have advice for UMM freshmen.

“Talk to professors a lot,” said senior Emily Johnson.  “I was scared of my profs at first, but they're really the best resource you have.”

Junior Ellie Ranum agrees, and also suggests that freshmen get involved with their floormates.

“I love that I can get to know the professors easily, and living in the dorms helped me to meet all of my friends,” she said. “I also love that there are events happening nearly every night on campus.”

Making connections is a vital part of how enjoyable one’s experience at UMM will be.  For sophomore Wyatt Anderson, these connections are one of the best things about UMM.

“My favorite thing about Morris is the sense of community that you get here,” he said.  “There is a place for everyone, and a chance to explore any interest you could possibly have.”

Although it is important to become involved in the campus community, it is equally important to balance the academic aspects of college life with one’s personal life.  Anderson offers advice on handling this balance.

“I prioritize my homework based on what needs to get done the soonest, and work my way down the list,” he said. “Taking notes is also super important, as well as talking to your professors if you have any questions.  I think everyone should take at least one course that has nothing to do with their major. It gives you a chance to try something new, and you might discover something you actually really enjoy.”
