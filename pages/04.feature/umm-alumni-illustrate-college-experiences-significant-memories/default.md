When a college-bound student tells a college-graduated adult about their future plans, the student is bound to hear some variation of, “college will be the best years of your life,” spoken with a wistful smile. Although some freshmen may think it’s mere nostalgia speaking, it’s clear that their years at Morris have left a significant impression upon these former students.

Morris alumnus Mike Galegher graduated UMM in 1972, and his years at UMM have left a strong impression on him.

“I think more than anything else, the relationships I made here among students and faculty really helped me feel like life was worth living,” he said. “I had a really balanced education between the sciences and the humanities; I feel like Morris prepared me to be a well-rounded individual, somebody who cares about people.”

Some of the most significant memories Galegher made on campus were those he made discovering his own opinions on controversial matters.

“When I was here, it was during the Vietnam War. There were a lot of discussions. The campus was pretty well-split, just as the country was split [on whether the U.S. should be involved]. I’ll never forget the discussions that we had about the war,” Galegher said. “When I came out of high school, I felt that if I went [to the war], I would go as a medic, and by the time I really talked about [the war] among friends and faculty members, I decided I was against the war. That was a pretty psychologically-formative moment for me. We had a moratorium on campus. Discussions would go deep into the night, so there was a lot of learning outside the classroom. I’m not sure that would’ve been available to me on a larger campus.”

Dave Hoppe, Class of 1973, was also affected by the discussions that took place on campus during the Vietnam War. On May 4, 1970, four students were killed after the Ohio National Guard opened fire on Kent State University students protesting the war.

“We were sophomores during [the Kent State shooting] and campus really shut down, classes were all suspended. It was a series of campus discussions.”

Like Galegher, Hoppe also felt that Morris helped him develop as a person.

“[Morris] helped me grow away from high school, away from some of the influences of being around home. I got a chance to meet lots of people, [who] are still good friends of mine, [and] the faculty, being a part of student government and working with other people on committees.”

Morris also helped 2017 graduate Matt Ebaugh connect with his peers.

“UMM taught me how to think critically, as well as how to engage in my community,” he said.

Sierra Brown, Class of 2016, found that her experiences at UMM helped her make important connections for her future.

“Having the sense of community here was really important in helping me build relationships that I can use in the future and in the industry,” said Brown. “Being able to have the accessibility that [students] have here with professors, research, and funding helps prepare [them] for the real world.”

Erin Lee, Class of 2017, also felt that her professors helped her prepare for her adult life.

“A lot of my professors were very helpful in job applications, and explained to me what [the] industry would be like compared to being in school. They gave a lot of really good advice and helped guide me into adulthood.”
2015 graduate Peter Braegelmann’s professors also helped him establish a place in the workforce.

“There was just a good selection of professors who taught me about certain pockets of science that carried me through, into industry,” he said.

The professors at UMM also made an impression on Ebaugh.

“Stephen Mark Carey, the German professor, is wonderful; he deserves a shoutout. He does more for his students than any other professor,” he said.

For Dillon McBrady, Class of 2013, the strongest memories were those he made with friends.

“Apart from really big experiences, the memories that last forever are the ones I had with close friends — the midnight Perkins runs to Alexandria,” he said. “The friends that I made are certainly more memorable than anything else.”

Lee remembers the late-night excursions she had with with her friends with fondness as well.

“Anytime some of us would be bored, we’d all pile in a car and go to Denny’s at 3:00 in the morning in Glenwood. That was always a good time,” she said. “You get to know people when you’re half-asleep on your way to get pancakes.”

McBrady encourages current students to take advantage of the opportunities for social experiences UMM has to offer.

“Experience everything you can; don’t dip your toe in the water. Morris is a safe enough campus where you can go for different experiences, so branch out. Experience things while you can, because once you get out of college, once you get a nine-to-five, that’s 
your life. Live life to the fullest because this is the one opportunity you’re going to have to do that.”

Galegher also advises current students to engage in student activities.

“Strive to do what you want to do in life,” he said. “Take advantage of opportunities when they’re coming towards you, not when they’re moving away.”

Daniel Fossen, class of 2016, offers advice to students debating which major to pursue.

“If you’re going to look at a major, you need to see how valuable it is in the real world [to help you] get an actual job because that’s the ultimate goal.”

Whether the impression UMM leaves you is personal, social, or philosophical, it is guaranteed to be a meaningful one, and whether you realize it or not, your experiences on this campus are affecting you even now.
