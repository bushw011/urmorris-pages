We’re approaching the end of the semester, and with that, many final exams, papers, and projects are all coming due at the same time. UMM does give students a day to study, which will be Monday, December 17. Then, as you’re all aware, fi- nalskickoffTuesday,December18!Clearly,thisisastressful time for all students. Your finals are very important, and you should give them the time they deserve in order to get the best grade you can. Remember, however, to take breaks if you need to. There’s plenty of activities happening around cam- pus if you’re looking for something to fill your time with! I’ve amassed as much information on as many events as I could. Use this feature as your non-comprehensive guide to the campus happenings over the last few weeks of the semester!

Yule Ball
Join UMM’s resident Potterheads for their biggest event all year. It’s time for the annual Yule Ball! Yule Ball is Saturday, December 8 from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. Yule Ball features a dance in Oyate Hall, plus catered food (included with your ticket) in Turtle Mountain Cafe and Harry Potter-themed activities scattered throughout the Student Center. You can find your fellow students running various events down in Louie’s Lower Level. Chemistry Club is hosting a Potions Lab, Psychology Club will be distributing the Ilvermorny Sorting Quiz, English Club is proctoring Harry Potter-themed trivia (with prizes!), Cougar PAWS is running a Fantastic Beasts scavenger hunt, Mock Trial is selling wands, and C.J. Lee will be reading tarot cards for curious witches and wizards. Through the tunnel in the Science Building, Biology Club is offering pictures with Ramses, our campus’s boa constrictor for $2. There will also be two costume contests in Edson Auditorium, one at 10 p.m. and one at 11 p.m. Come dressed in your best 1920s outfit or Harry Potter gear, or come in your best formal wear!

Want to get involved with Yule Ball? Consider volunteering to help with the Mini Wizards event! This event will be in Oyate Hall during the afternoon before the dance, from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m., and is geared towards local kids so that they can experience the magic, too. If you want to help with Mini Wizards, contact Chelsea Young at youn1920@morris.umn.edu

All events throughout the evening are free for everyone. Admission to the dance, which has dinner included, is $3 per single ticket, or you can bring a pal and get two tickets for $5!

Meiningens De-stressor Event 
The Meiningens Student Theatre Organization will be hosting a de-stressing event on the study day, Monday, December 17 from 7 to 9:30 p.m. If you need a break from studying or just want to chat with people, feel free to join our local thespians in Louie’s Lower Level for board games, coloring, and essential oils. This event is come-and-go, so feel free to drop in whenever you need a break!

Scream on the Mall
It is time for this semester’s Scream on the Mall event, hosted by Meme Team. At 4 p.m. on December 16, join Meme Team in the Student Center for an energetic release of stress. Have your finals got you down? Too many papers stacking up at the same time? Take a few minutes out of your Sunday to scream it out with other stressed students. 

Library Events
Stop in to Briggs Library for de-stressing events all throughout finals week! There will be free 5-minute massages available for students as well as hot drinks to keep away the cold. The library is also a fantastic space to study or get assistance from your peer tutors and the writing center, so be sure to take advantage of those resources leading up to finals week. 

Accompanying Recitals 
The Accompanying class, MUS 1050, will be having a free recital on Thursday, December 13 at 6:15 p.m. This class will feature five students accompanying each other on piano, as well as student vocalists Shane McKinley and Victoria Evens. In a rare treat, there will also be some harpsichord music!
