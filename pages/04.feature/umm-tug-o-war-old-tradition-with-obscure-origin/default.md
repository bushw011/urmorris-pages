The Homecoming Tug-O-War between Gay Hall and Indy Hall is one of UMM’s oldest traditions, beginning in 1974. It is also the tradition with the most mysterious past.

“Nobody in ‘74 thought [the Tug-O-War] was going to be a tradition,” said Area Coordinator of Residential Life, Ryan Schamp. “No 18 year-old student in one of these halls was thinking, ‘Oh, 40 years later, they’ll still be doing this.’ There’s no records from that time as far as I can tell. The only reason we know who won or lost [and] when is because they had a garbage can lid that we can look at.”

Schamp has been working at UMM for eight years. At the Tug-O-War, he announces the rules and plays music. After a winner has been determined, Schamp raises the winning hall’s flag over Tug Lake. The flag is a relatively new part of the Tug-O-War, only about five years old, but it quickly became an important part of the tradition. The Tug Lake flagpole has even become a part of other events on campus such as Zombie Prom and Yule Ball. It also promotes special days: on May 25, a towel is run up the flagpole to commemorate Hitchhiker’s Guide To the Galaxy’s Towel Day; a Star Wars flag flies to celebrate May 4; and on Pi Day, March 14, a pie flag is raised.

“Although that pole was meant for just the Tug, it’s become a bigger part of our identity,” said Schamp, “and I think it’s neat that we have a flagpole that runs up flags that aren’t necessarily denoting nations or cities or states, but flags that are going up to promote a state of being. One of my favorite things about this campus is running up a flag over that lake.”

In addition to handling the flag, Schamp has also helped handle the Tug-O-War trophy: a garbage can lid inscribed with the history of tug-of-war winners.

“[The trophy] was handled lovingly and with great care. You can tell they really cared about what it was because there’s something about the fact that they were able to keep the lid switching between halls without Housing acting as mediators of it,” he said. “Now, we act as the owners of that trophy. We’ve taken over ownership of it. To me, there’s something that speaks about the great care they must have had for it to be able to keep this tradition alive and pass this same thing back and forth for years.”

The original trophy is hanging in a shadowbox in the student center. After 2013, the lid had no available space left for the next year’s winner. A new garbage can lid had to be found. Although this may seem like a simple task, it proved more difficult than expected.

“The [garbage can lid] that they had back in ‘74 was stout. It is so heavy and so thick that trying to mimic that today was just impossible,” Schamp said. “We went to hardware stores and tried to find garbage can lids, and they’re all much thinner, they’re all made 
from aluminum, and they’re very flimsy.”

The new trophy is from a 1970s garbage can purchased on eBay; the lid became the new trophy and the can itself is now used as a decoration for Zombie Prom. About five years ago, shadow boxes were installed in Gay Hall and Indy Hall as displays for the winner of the Tug-O-War to display their trophy.

The trophy isn’t the only new thing about this old tradition – in 2007, the rope broke, causing the competition to result in a draw. 
Currently, the Tug-O-War uses a three inch thick rope from a naval supply company – the type of rope commonly used to tie large ships to the dock.

Associate Director of Residential Life, Tom Ladner, is in charge of the rope. He’s been trained to move the rope, an act which requires a forklift and a team of eight volunteers. Ladner finds that the Tug-O-War is a way to bring students together early in the school year.

“[The Tug-O-War] is an opportunity to create some bonds between students. It’s early in the year, maybe not everybody is familiar with everybody, so it’s a good, large group activity to bring Gay and Indy together,” he said.

While the Tug-O-War may allow students from Gay Hall and Indy Hall to bond, these are not the only halls involved in the competition. Students from Pine Hall gather each year to protest the tug-of-war.

“I think [Pine’s protest] is my favorite thing about the Tug, in a way, because I like the idea that they put up a front that they’re offended that they’re not included in this event,” Schamp said. “The most popular [protesting] idea so far has been Pine Hall trying to occupy the lake as their protest. One of my favorites was when Pine came out and turned their backs to the whole Tug and just pretended that nobody was there; I thought that was a really clever way of [protesting].”

Although the Tug-O-War is a tradition built on competition, and in Pine Hall’s case, opposition, the rivalry between the halls is false, and allows the students to bond in mock conflict.

“Both sides get to participate equally, even if they win or lose. Both [halls] celebrate, but one celebrates their victory and one celebrates their loss, and they celebrate it together,” Schamp said. “The false rivalry allows the two halls to form a cohesive identity, and I think that the celebration of both the loss and the victory allows students to develop a sense of ownership of the hall. That’s where the biggest benefit is. Once the students feel like they own the place, like they’ve had buy in it and it belongs to them, everything’s better from our perspective. Students treat their community with more respect, they treat the hall itself with more respect, and they treat UMM with more respect.

For all the impact that the Tug-O-War has, and all the time that goes into its preparation, the event itself is remarkably short.

“I think [the Tug-O-War] is one of the quirkiest things we do, and every year we marvel at how much work goes into it to then only last nine seconds,” said Schamp. “I’m always amazed at how much of an impact it actually has, how much those nine seconds actually matter to participants.”
