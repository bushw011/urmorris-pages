Let’s be optimistic about the weather for a second. Despite being a small town known for its cold weather, Morris has quite a few places to go to enjoy the springtime. When the weather warms up, be sure to visit these featured areas around town.

**East Side Park**

East Side Park is located on East 7th Street. There, you can find the Killoran Music Arts Centre, named after Eleanor G. Killoran and Samuel H. Grosland, where visiting artists such as Mallory Hope and Sarah Groves have played. The park also has a picnic area with a shelter, grills, and a basketball court. And if you ever feel like revisiting your childhood and escaping from college life for a while, you can visit East Side Park to use the swingset or playground there.

**Wells Park**

Wells Park is located on Pacific Avenue, and has plenty of sports amenities. There are two softball fields, a batting cage, and lighted basketball courts at the park. There are grills and a picnic area nearby. The Prairie Renaissance Skate Park is a part of Wells Park. The skating rink is open from 8am to 11pm. Wells Park has a playground as well; all equipment was donated by Morris Area Women of Today.

**Pomme de Terre Park**

The Pomme de Terre Park, located east of Morris on County Road 10, is next to the Pomme de Terre River. It has a campsites with electrical hookups, restrooms and showers, a frisbee golf course, a playground, and a sheltered picnic area. Visitors can also canoe and fish in the Pomme de Terre River. The park also has a paved walking and biking path, a horseshoe pit, and a shelter with a kitchen. You can also visit the Pomme de Terre overlook, located off of County Road 10, from which you can see Pomme de Terre River from above and visit the wind turbines.

**Horticulture Display Garden**

The West Central Research and Outreach Center's (WCROC) Horticulture Display Garden is located at 46353 State Highway. It was established with support from numerous donors and is open to the public from dawn until dusk during growing season. Visitors are welcome to picnic in the gardens, either at the picnic tables, under the gazebo, or on a blanket on the grass. The garden is accessible and there are walking paths which span the garden. The garden’s plants include container plantings, perennials, native plantings, ornamental grasses, hostas, and more.

**Campus Conservatory**

If the weather isn’t warm enough to visit the parks or the plants at the Horticulture Display Garden haven’t bloomed yet, visit the conservatory on campus. It is attached to the science building and has plants, finches, bamboo shoots, exotic trees, a koi fish pond, and a bench to sit and admire it all.
