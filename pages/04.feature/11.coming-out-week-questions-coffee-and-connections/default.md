This week, the Morris Queer Student Initiative for Equality, or MoQSIE, hosted their third annual Coming Out Week on our campus. The past two years, MoQSIE has celebrated the campus’ LGBTQIA2S+ community and their experiences by planning a week’s worth of celebration, discussion, and education. This year, they continued the tradition with a diverse lineup of welcoming events. 

Monday, October 8, MoQSIE hosted a coffee chat, moderated by Rachael Knafla. True to midwest tradition, those who attended the coffee chat enjoyed an assortment of bars and warm coffee while they discussed the importance of coming out and different views held by the community. They also covered the existence of Coming Out Day, whether or not it’s a good thing to have a whole day dedicated to coming out, and talked about why an individual may choose to come out. 

Tuesday, October 9, was the Queeriosity Panel. This panel was directly aimed at people questioning their own identities and those who were simply eager to learn more about the LGBTQIA2S+ community and the issues they face. The panel was moderated by Kara Black, who opened the panel with a presentation concerning terminology used within the community, as well as sharing resources for LGBT-identifying students on- and off-campus. The panel featured English faculty member Angela Hume and students Maija Kittleson, Carter Young, and Aaron Otten. The panel provided a space for curious students to ask questions in a respectful manner and receive a straight answer, as well as a space to give people a word for what they were feeling. True to MoQSIE form, they also supplied grilled cheese and tomato soup for the panel attendees. 

Wednesday, October 9, was MoQSIE’s regular weekly meeting, but it was also Gay Movie Night! In the Resource Center for Gender, Women, and Sexuality, or RCGWS, in the basement of the Multiethnic Resource Center, students gathered to watch the 2017 film Freak Show. The film centers around a young gender non-conforming student at a conservative high school coming to terms and thoroughly embracing their own identity. 

Thursday, October 10, was the official Coming Out Day, and was capped off by the last of MoQSIE’s events for this past week. Students gather in Oyate hall for the Coming Out Conversation event. Following Wednesday’s bitter cold rain and snow, students were invited to enjoy warm drinks in the hall and share their own personal coming out stories. 

Students I spoke with expressed how appreciated MoQSIE was for giving a space to out, questioning, and closeted students alike. Remember, friends: it’s okay to not be heterosexual. It’s okay to be heterosexual. It’s okay to be gender non-
conforming. It’s okay to be cisgender. It’s okay to be comfortable in your own skin and with who you are. If you are a member of the LGBTQIA2S+ community, it is 100% your choice to come out, and you should never let anyone pressure you to make choices about your life.

You’re a human being deserving of respect and love, and so is everyone else.
