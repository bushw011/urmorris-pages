Between economic difficulties, regular academic responsibilities, and a global pandemic, midterms can feel like the last thing anyone would want added to their plate in an already stressful time. For some, it can be hard to keep up a positive mindset all of the time. For others, the struggle lies in being overwhelmed and overworked with no time to relax.

An overload of stress can be harmful for not only the mind, but the body as well. According to the Mayo Clinic, some common effects of stress on the body can include headaches, nausea, muscle tension, and fatigue. It can also cause you to be more anxious, restless, and have a lack of motivation.

Whether the workload is too heavy or you are just not having a great time, here are some stress relief tips to push through the midterm fog.

**Set workload boundaries with yourself and others.** Boundaries are important in many areas of life, such as having a personal space ‘bubble’ (which is great for social distancing reasons). Boundaries are especially important when it comes to the amount of work you can handle at one time.

**Take a break every once in a while.** Get up and stretch, go for a walk, have a snack, or do whatever you can to give your brain a moment to rest.

**Take more naps.** I am not going to say ‘Go to bed earlier’ because being able to set and keep a regular sleep schedule can be a challenge for many college students (including myself). Find times to take an hour-long nap when needed to relax and give your body a much-needed break.

**Try some yoga.** The RFC is currently offering in-person stress relief yoga classes Mondays from 1:10-1:50 and Wednesdays from 12:10-12:50. They also have online classes available on their website.

**Spend some time with friends.** You could do something productive, such as studying together in-person or online, or do something fun like watching movies or gaming together.

**Attend one of the many clubs on campus.** If you are interested in theatre or comedy, Improv Club meets from 9:30-11 on Wednesday nights in Edson Auditorium and Meiningens Student Theatre Club meets on Fridays from 5:15-6:15 with both in-person and online events. If you are looking for something more relaxed, Floating World Prose meets Tuesdays starting at 8:30 over Zoom and Floating World Poetry meets Thursdays starting at 8:30 over Zoom.

**Have a night to yourself!** Take a long bath, cuddle up with some blankets, make yourself some cocoa, and do whatever it is you may do in your free time.
