On August 22, the mall was flooded with freshmen eager to participate in the many student organizations Morris has to offer, numerous club leaders behind colorful booths, and the fresh energy that encompasses a new school year.  The student activities fair had begun.

Student Activities and Leadership Coordinator Simón Franco was responsible for coordinating the activities fair.  He finds that student organizations are a great way to integrate freshmen into campus life.

"It’s very important for students to develop support networks after leaving home and transitioning into their college years,” he said.  “The idea is that we spend the first 15-16 years of our lives developing those networks that include your parents, friends, siblings, and teachers, and then we leave all of that behind as we move to college.  So, we need to develop those support networks again to be successful at the university.  So, it’s very important for students to get involved and form those networks.  Those don’t happen organically in your classroom, particularly if you have a professor lecturing, so we provide a forum for students to do that.”

Freshman Gabrielle Smoger, a member of speech club, agrees with Franco.

“I think [speech club] is going to make me really happy.  I think I’m really going to love competing at the college level.  It’s going to make me a happier person and a better writer,” she said.

Smoger decided to join speech club because she participated in speech club in her high school and wanted to try it at a college level.  For students without prior experience in a club, some booths had tactics to encourage new members, such as free candy or field trips later in the year.  For freshman HarleyJo Bailey, these methods were effective.

“Throwback Company gave me candy and QDW (Queer Devil Worshippers) said if I signed up, I’d get a free t-shirt,” she said.

Like Smoger, Bailey has found that being a part of a student organization has helped her adjust to life on campus.

“I have a hard time making friends, but being able to do this makes me feel like I’m actually a part of the school,” she said.

The French Club also finds that involvement in clubs can improve a student’s experience at UMM.

“Staying involved in clubs and orgs can even the tipping point for students who may feel that college isn't for them,” said French Club.  “Having a group you can belong to goes a long way in helping you build stronger relationships with other students, staff, faculty, and community members on and off campus.”

UMM’s imrov club believes that joining a club will integrate students into a larger community.

“I think students will gain an expanded community that they wouldn’t normally be a part of by being active in student orgs on campus,” the Improv Club said.  “We have such a diverse set of interests within our campus life that we love to showcase, and I think it makes the transition from high school to college so much easier for first year students.  Additionally, you get to explore your interests without having to major in a particular subject.”

Students may not realize that all clubs are open to anyone, whether or not they are pursuing the club’s focus as a major.  To help students discover their club, the Computer Science Club hosts a gaming party open to everyone.

“[We have] events that are open to everyone. People think that computer science is a really technical. Events like the LAN Party shows people that there’s a beginning,” said the Computer Science Club.

While it’s important for students to join clubs and get involved with peers, it’s also important to remember to maintain a healthy balance between the social and academic aspects of college.  Franco encourages freshmen to join as many clubs as they can at the start of the school year, and then drop out of a few once their workloads grow heavier.

“Students [sometimes become] so engaged in their clubs and organizations that they forgo the academic aspect of it.  We want them to have a balance,” Franco said.  “It’s a matter of joining up early on, and as the rigors of your classes start to take a toll on your time, realizing that it’s okay to take a step back.”
