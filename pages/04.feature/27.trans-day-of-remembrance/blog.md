The UMM campus banded together to mourn the loss of transgender people on November 20, 2019, to acknowledge the Transgender Day of Remembrance. Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDoR) was started in 1999 by Gwendolyn Ann Smith, who hosted a candelight vigil in honor of Rita Hester, a transgender woman who was murdered. On November 20, UMM held a candlelight vigil of our own to honor the transgender students in the same way. This event was hosted by Kara Black, third year. The names of transgender people who were killed from November 20, 2018 until today were read aloud. Hanging outside the student center were posters of 26 transgender people who were murdered over the course of the year. 26 candles were lit; one for each person.

“[Reading at the vigil] is hard,” Black told us. “It’s a lot of mental and emotional work to decide what to say and how to say it, so that’s usually what is in the forefront of my mind. TDoR is always a very emotional event. It feels a lot like a funeral. A lot of people always cry, including myself, but it’s a good thing to be able to publicly vulnerable like that and to be there for each other.”

Chelsea Young, QUEST and LGBT+ mentor, spoke to us about the impact and importance of this vigil. “TDoR is immensely important not only for the trans population on the Morris campus, but for every student, staff, and faculty member to be able to recognize the large scale injustice that is affecting a significant number of individuals. For many trans individuals, they had no family or relatives to mourn or search for justice in their name, meaning that the respects we are paying on our campus are necessary and meaningful.”

“A lot of people have the mistaken belief that transphobia is limited to just calling people by the wrong name or pronouns,” Black said.

“TDoR is a reminder to those people that this is just the tip of the iceberg. The beliefs that lead some people to misgender, deadname, or otherwise disrespect trans people are the same beliefs that lead other people to assault or murder us.”

Given the recent campus climate, Trans Day of Remembrance is important for us. Many students, in response to posters hung around campus, felt unsafe and unwelcome on campus. The service served as a reminder of the transphobia many students still face today, but also a way to stand together in solidarity. “TDoR is a day for society to recognize the anger and violence forced onto the trans community and give retribution to the individuals that have suffered because of it,” Young said.

There a call to action in Black’s speech: “Most of us here are not the primary targets. It is difficult to remember that on a day like this, where we, rightfully, take a moment to focus on just one axis of oppression. It is also more important to remember on a day like today. A lot of us here are white, that gives us a lot of protection. A lot of us here are from Minnesota and will stay in Minnesota, which has better laws protecting LGBTQ+ people than many other states. Just by being able to go to college at all, not to mention managing to graduate, implies that most of us here have at least some amount of privilege. By keeping our heads down and staying quiet, most of us could stay relatively safe. Most of us could live with this. But how could you live with yourself?”

Young offered solidarity to the trans and larger LGBT+ campus community: “When we band together, change is possible, but we all must make a conscious decision to fight for that change. The best way to protect the LGBTQ+ community is to respect the LGBTQ+ community. Validating a person’s existence and identity is not an ‘agree to disagree’ situation; it is the act of being an educated and prudent individual. LGBTQ+ people do not deserve to live surrounded by slurs and anger directed at areas of their lives that they do not have the ability to change. The freedom of speech is one of the most important rights that people have, and I encourage the campus to continue to remember that that right also gives people the ability to speak out against the hurtful and insulting messages that are strewn around our campus.”

Black closed their speech with the following: “When your neighbors are threatened, will you open your home to them? Will you hide them when the police or military come to take them away? Will you lie to keep people safe? When someone points a gun at the person behind you and tells you to move, will you move? And what will you tell your children? Or your grandchildren? If you are lucky enough to live to meet them?

“If you are not proud of your answers to those questions, you have the ability to change them. You are able to help. The world is a mess, and there is a lot of work that needs to be done to fix it. You are not obligated to complete that work, but neither are you at liberty to abandon it.”
