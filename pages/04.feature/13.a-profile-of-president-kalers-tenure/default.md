President Eric Kaler has seen many successes and failures in his time serving as the President of the University of Minnesota system, chief among them the tuition freezes secured for the academic years starting in 2013 and 2014 and the controversy over his salary that began in 2013.

Eric Kaler is the second alumnus of the University of Minnesota to hold the position of President of the University of Minnesota system. He graduated from the California Institute of Technology before earning his Ph.D in chemical engineering from the Twin Cities campus. After earning his Ph.D, he taught at the University of Washington in Seattle and the University of Delaware before assuming the position of provost at Stony Brook University in New York. 

During his time teaching, he did earn a number of plaudits, including awards for his materials science research, an award for promoting women’s equity on the University of Delaware campus, and a visiting professorship to the University of Graz, Austria.

He served as provost for two years upon being offered the job of President of the U of M system. It is reported that he turned the position down upon first offer, when one of the members of the board of regents remarked, “It’s not every day that you get offered the job of President.” Upon further consideration, he accepted and began leading his alma mater.

His first challenge as President involved meeting with the legislature over the budget for the system and the state’s share of funding. Appropriations negotiated from the state had been on a decline with his predecessor, President Robert Bruininks, and declined further for the 2011-2012 academic year. He managed to keep the tuition to the smallest increase it had seen this century for the 2012-2013 academic year, but that is admittedly not saying much when there has been only two presidents thus far this century.

A study of higher education spending and management published in The Wall Street Journal charged that the University system had disproportionate growth in its administrative body relative to the growth of the student body and the faculty body. Kaler did not dispute the size of the administration, but defended the system because it had managed to keep administrative costs low and increase the system’s productivity despite the continued disinvestment of the state.

It is not surprising that arguments over finances have defined the tenure of President Kaler, with the tumultuous state of higher education financing in the country. Students are seeing a climbing cost of attendance between tuition hikes, rent, transportation, inflation, and stagnant wages for most jobs typically held by college students, i.e. service industry, research internships, and seasonal positions.

President Kaler has been vital in securing funding streams beyond state appropriations. Donations and fundraising campaigns are a fact of life now for higher education, as evidenced by our our campaign, Driven. President Kaler was able to secure unusual funding streams to keep tuition down in years without a tuition freeze from the state. Many of the new programs that have been instituted under his tenure rely on non-institutional funding. The vulnerability of these programs is a question left unresolved, and more salient with his coming retirement.

Eric Kaler was not the first president to face these institutional problems, and he is unlikely to be the last. With three new chancellors at University of Minnesota campuses, we can hope that the next leader has enough of a clean slate to institute a vision for the university system that has been missing during much of President Kaler’s tenure.
