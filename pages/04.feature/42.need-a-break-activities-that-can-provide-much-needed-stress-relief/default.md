With midterms coming to a close, many students may be looking for a way to take a moment and relax. Schoolwork can pile up easily and that often is overwhelming - I would know - especially when students have other responsibilities such as running or participating in campus clubs and organizations or having a job. Here are some ways to unwind that are do-able in the midst of the pandemic:

• Visit the greenhouse- The greenhouse and conservatory on campus are wonderful places to get a breath of fresh air - with masks on - and see some interesting plant life. There are also opportunities for some photography with the abundance of colorful flowers and scenery. The greenhouse and conservatory are located on the lower level of the Science Building.

• Take a trip to the library- If you’re looking for a new read, you can browse the shelves of the Briggs Library on campus. It is open seven days a week with somewhat limited hours on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. You can also try the Morris Public Library which offers curbside pickup for library materials.

• Try out some digital books- Alternatively, there are some great library apps that are free and only require a library card that can be from a wide selection of libraries. My personal recommendation would have to be Libby, which features thousands of ebooks, magazines, and audiobooks through the library system of your choice.

• Go to one of several events that Briggs Library is hosting which include:

		• Virtual Game Night via Zoom- “Play virtual games JackBox and Among Us. You download the app, join the Zoom Room and Briggs Library will do the rest. 				Have some fun on the evening before Break Day!” The zoom link can be found on the library website. This event takes place on March 29 from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.
        
		• Briggs Library Book Club- “The Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett is a multi-generational family saga set between the 1940s to the 1990s and centers on identical
		twin sisters Desiree and Stella Vignes, who run away from home at the age of sixteen. The book tracks their lives across generations, as their lives branch away
		from each other and yet remain intertwined. It’s a story that explores the intricacies of identity, family and race. The novel was a 2020 National Book Award 				Longlist winner.” The zoom link can be found on the library website. This event takes place on March 31 from 11 a.m to 12 p.m.
        
		• Asking the Big Questions- “Join the conversation as we explore the topic of superheroes. Brad Deane (English) examines the history of comic book 
		superheroes from the Golden Age and Silver Age, offering some explanations as to why the genre is so enduring.” The zoom link can be found on the library 
		website. This event takes place on March 31 from 7 p.m to 8 p.m. 
        
        • An Evening of Poetry- “Two notable poets, Nancy Naomi Carlson and Teri Ellen Cross Davis, will share their work and discuss their inspiration from the theme 
		of Writing Women’s Lives on Friday, April 9 at 7:00 p.m. This event is part of the Prairie Gate Literary Festival’s 2021 offerings. Athena Kildegaard will moderate 
		the discussion.” The zoom link can be found on the library website.

• Go thrift shopping. This is a fun and inexpensive way to update your wardrobe or to find that perfect outfit. Aside from clothing, they also offer a selection of kitchenware and appliances, decorative items, knicknacks, and much more. Someplace Safe is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
