In 1990, November was declared National Native American Heritage Month. This year, on November 7, a canvas tipi was set up on the mall to commemorate the month and celebrate the Native American presence on campus.

“There is that cultural history and significance to the tipi,” said Native American Student Success Project Manager Raymond Burns. “At the very basic level, it’s a house; it’s where people live. But on a symbolic level, it’s to show that the Dakota people still have a presence on campus.”

Twenty-one percent of the UMM student body is Native American, and the campus held multiple events to recognize their heritage. Other than the tipi, there was an opening blessing on November 1, a winter social on November 3, bingo on November 8, and an Indian taco sale on November 16. On November 21, there will be a Dakota/Ojibwa dance troupe performance in Edson from 6-8 p.m. which will provide storytelling through song and dance. These events are not only meant to recognize the current Native American students, but also the Dakota people who used to live on the campus grounds.

“The campus is located on ancestral grounds for the Dakota people and the tipi is a visual representation and a reminder that these were once their grounds,” Burns said. “It’s important to show the relationship that the campus has with the original people here.”

The canvas tipi not only reflects the heritage of the current students and the campus’ history with the Dakota people, but also the history of Native American customs in general.

“The intent for [the tipi] was to celebrate our American Indian awareness and visibility,” said Multi-Ethnic Student Program Associate Director Gus Claymore. “[The tipi shows] the way that our ancestors lived in the environment. That’s what they lived in, what they raised their children in.”

More than a physical structure, the tipi carries a myriad of symbolic significance as well. The poles of a tipi represent values essential to Native American beliefs: obedience toward elders, respect toward other people, humility, happiness, love toward both others and oneself, faith, kinship, spiritual cleanliness, thankfulness, sharing, spiritual strength, good child-rearing, hope, and ultimate protection. The number of poles in a tipi depends on the tribe the tipi belongs to, but in any case, they are meaningful and represent the values important to the tribe. Morris’ tipi, which was put up by Lower Sioux Tribe members,  has 15 poles. 

The poles are not the only significant part of the tipi. The direction in which the opening faces also carries meaning. The opening of the tipi faces east, which represents sunlight, warmth, and the spirit of women, and allows the inhabitants of the tipi to greet the dawn when exiting the tipi in the morning. 

The tipi on the mall will only last until shortly before Thanksgiving Break commences, but the symbolic significance that it carries will last much longer to those who truly appreciate it.

“Native American Heritage Month is an important month in that it allows the native and indigenous people to show the history and vibrancy of their culture, but in another sense, it shouldn’t just be a month,” said Burns. “It should be a year-long thing.”

The principles that the tipi stands for — love and respect toward others and oneself, humility in reverence to the earth, gratitude and kinship — should be principles that one keeps in mind every day, rather than only recognized when a holiday causes them to resurface. Even though Native American Heritage Month officially ends on November 30, one should always recognize and respect other individuals, regardless of spiritual beliefs, race, or ethnicity.

Burns recognizes the importance of continuing respect after the month ends, and also hopes that the month in which Native American Heritage Month has been set does not distract from the importance of the meaning behind the celebration.

“The one thing I have a small issue with is that it’s the same month as Thanksgiving, which has a whole other connotation for native people,” Burns said. “It’s an interesting dichotomy of having a month to celebrate the heritage of Native people when one of the biggest holidays of the year whitewashes that same history to become a national holiday.”
