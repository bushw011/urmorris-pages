While it seems that in-person camaraderie and group hangouts are ill-advised for the time being, many student orgs are finding pandemic-friendly ways to combat social isolation with their members. 

Here is what some student leaders had to say when asked about changes to their organizations this semester:

**How are your meetings different this semester?**

“All of the clubs I’m active in have shifted the majority of regular events online. The process for getting in-person events approved isn’t extremely laborious, but it’s more work than has been required in the past and that alone is enough to dissuade clubs from scheduling things in person when possible.” - Cal Mergendahl, officer in Chemistry Club and KUMM

“All our meetings are over Zoom.” - CJ Lee, Co-chair of Floating World Prose

“Our meetings look super different this year as they are hosted on Zoom. Depending on how things progress, we may reevaluate and host meetings in-person—but as of right now we are entirely online.” - Katie Buschmann, Co-chair of Floating World Prose

“The biggest difference with our meetings this year is location—we’re now meeting in Cow Palace instead of LLL. We also have a Zoom call up for folks who still want to watch the movie but don’t want to come in person.” - Officer in BMC

“We’ve moved meetings online, both for exec staff and for our general meetings. It’s been a bit of a tough transition, but the amount of planning and paperwork needed to meet physically isn’t worth the effort in the long term. We’re a bit different in that our usual radio activities are a person or two in the studio, so we’re doing our best to ensure that the station is as safe as we possibly can make it. We have also added the option for DJ’s to broadcast their shows remotely this year, which is honestly pretty cool, as it adds more access to KUMM for those who aren’t necessarily on campus, and opens the window for a lot of interesting future activities.” - Peter Truckenmiller, Station Manager of KUMM

“We have been utilizing Zoom to host our meeting for this semester. With this we have also been trying to use different online games and programs so we can interact and have fun with all our club members from a safe distance. We were able to have an in-person event for our reception to kick off the semester which was a safely distanced good time, though moving forward we’re going to gear towards having our larger events online for the foreseeable future until our campus is in a safer place with COVID.” - Sloane Mordecai, Co-chair of MoQSIE

**What do you like/dislike about these changes?**

“I think the changes are being done for the right reasons, and I’m willing to accept the extra inconvenience -- although I’m unsure if their enforcement and policy are sufficient to effectively prevent the spread.” - Cal Mergendahl

“I don’t like these changes because the energy is not the same. The way our energy builds off each other is interrupted by a computer screen.” - CJ Lee

“I feel like one of the things I like is that it’s easier for people to access because they just have to log in -- as opposed to walking to a physical location. But there are still a plethora of problems. We had to reframe how we give prompts to members and how we play some of our games. Zoom also, naturally, comes with its fair share of technical difficulties.” - Katie Buschmann

“The move has been kind of nice because the screen in Cow Palace is a lot bigger than the TV, but I miss the atmosphere of just hanging out on couches in LLL.” - BMC Officer

“We’re managing things fairly well, the most important thing for us is keeping everyone as safe as possible while still providing a high-quality radio experience. It has been challenging, as we only found out details on guidelines about two weeks before we returned to campus, and we’re still polishing out the final steps of our plan. We’re trying to take as many safety precautions as possible, and given that we manage our own space, there are things we’re planning on doing that are at times stricter than the guidelines given by the university, just because we feel it’s the best thing to do for our club members. Overall, I’m in full support of anything we can do to keep people safe, though I wish there was more transparency in university actions, and that club leaders were consulted when making event guidelines. From the general vibe of other club leaders we’re all trying our best, but physical events are so much more difficult and time consuming to plan, and unfortunately that is reflected in how active we can be on campus.” - Peter Truckenmiller

“I dislike not being able to interact in person like normal, especially with our new incoming students. Though, I would easily sacrifice closer interactions if it means keeping everyone healthy and safe. I think learning how to adjust to campus life with COVID has actually brought our club members closer together and the sense of community has been stronger than ever within the LGBTQIA2S+ community at UMM.” - Sloane Mordecai

**Any thoughts on how the Morris administration is enforcing these new guidelines?**

“My impression is that, frankly, administration has done an extremely poor job setting a good example for students. The guidelines regarding mask use and distancing are essentially identical to the Minnesota guidelines regarding mask use in the workplace and public spaces. Beyond this, the university has acted with the minimum of possible transparency, and a maximum of placing responsibility [on] students. Students are willing to accept responsibility for the most part, but the university has made students feel that we will be blamed if things go wrong -- when the university was the one that said it was safe to return.” - Cal Mergendahl

“I don’t know if Morris is really enforcing the guidelines outside of the bare minimum of making sure no one spends any time in indoor public spaces.” - CJ Lee

“Overall administration left it up to the club’s discretion, but administration did highly recommend having [club] meetings on Zoom -- or at least have both in-person and online. I think that’s a fair choice. I do wish we were kept more ‘in the loop’ with the decisions they were making -- the short notice of new guidelines made it somewhat difficult to plan out club meetings in advance.” - Katie Buschmann

“I wasn’t super involved in making the changes administration was looking for, but I appreciate that we had a way to continue having BMC in-person. The Zoom calls often don’t work well for our club -- the movies lag, and it limits which movies we can watch (certain streaming services won’t let you screen share their content).” - BMC Officer

“My biggest issue is honestly a lack of transparency. From the experience of myself and other club leaders there’s a lot of things that aren’t being evenly enforced, or are left unclear, leaving us all to try and figure a lot out on our own. So much of student life on campus is run by clubs and organizations, and as the system is currently, getting students together is challenging. We usually rely on the activities fair to get a lot of recruitment done, and just trying to reach out to students, especially people who aren’t heavily online is challenging. I’d honestly love to see more student input in how the planning processes are approved, and how guidelines are set, as right now I think we’re all fighting an uphill battle to get things done in a somewhat normal fashion. I love Morris, and I understand that this is unfamiliar territory for everyone, but as it sits now the majority of the work of ensuring that students are kept safe and engaged in events on campus is falling on the shoulders of other students, who are facing the same isolation and stressors as everyone else on campus. Giving us a place for student input and voices in both the planning and enforcing of guidelines would be fantastic. Student orgs and events are one of the most vital parts of the Morris community, but they’re also a labour of love. Every student org leader is doing this because they have passion for what they do, but I feel the lack of clear communication and support from an administrative end has slowed us all down significantly.” - Peter Truckenmiller

“I think there is still a long way to go with administration. They have decent guidelines set in place for around campus, however from what I have seen while being on campus there has not been as much backing on these rules as there should be. I also think the lack of transparency between admin to faculty and students adds to this issue and this should be worked to be solved so we can all be on the same page.” - Sloane Mordecai

**Other thoughts regarding your club this semester?**

“In my opinion we are adjust[ing] as well as could be expected. I’m bummed that I haven’t met any of the new people in the club in person but we’re adjusting fine.” - CJ Lee

“I think overall Floating World is doing great. We had a few things to figure out, but we got on track and are looking forward to a fun semester.” - Katie Buschmann

“Watch and make fun of movies with the Bad Movie Club. We are now meeting in Cow Palace, Fridays at 7.” - BMC Officer

“If you find yourself with some spare time in your schedule, or want to get involved in something bigger, KUMM is a great place for you. We’ve always been a club that allows people to be as involved as they want to be, but with the addition of remote broadcasting we really hope that more people will get involved this semester. It’s a great way to find something to fill your time and listen to other people without having to physically be together, and I know all of us here at the station are really excited to see what types of shows people come up with after being locked in quarantine for a couple months. I think the changes we’re making are actually pretty positive, as any opportunity to let more people participate in radio is a good one in my eyes, and being able to broadcast either in studio or from the comfort of your room is a good one. We also have opportunities to review music for our music department or get involved in our news department that you can do without leaving the comfort of your bed. Things have been a bit tricky, but we’re really trying to look on the bright side, and encourage people who may not have had the time or the ability to get involved in college radio in the past to get in touch with us, or at least tune into a friendly voice on the radio to keep you from going too stir crazy in the dorms.” - Peter Truckenmiller

“I think this new normal is a challenge that is being taken on to the best of abilities by all student org leaders, and that especially for MoQSIE we have a strong community of folks that will help us keep up and running during the pandemic. Check out the MoQSIE Campus Connections page to join our club that meets Tuesdays at 6:30 via Zoom, and you can also get the link to join our club Discord.” - Sloane Mordecai

**Looking Ahead**

Zoom appears to be the primary form of face-to-face social interaction these days, excluding the familiar faces you may briefly see at the dining hall while picking up a green box. It is no surprise that a common complaint among club members is the lack of ‘atmosphere.’ There is something particularly special about in-person meetings that creates inside jokes, inspires late-night group runs to Casey’s or the C-Store, and makes lasting memories.
Please wear a mask (or other PPE), wash your hands, practice social distancing, ect., so that someday,hopefully soon, we will be able to have these experiences together once more.
