Halloween is almost here and both on-campus and off-campus events are happening all over Morris!

**Pumpkin Painting Party:** This fun painting activity sponsored by the Peer Health Educators is happening at Oyate Hall from 2:30 p.m.-5:30 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 25.

**Halloween Reading and Trivia Night:** While the English Club usually puts on a Halloween Reading event every year, this year they are collaborating with Briggs Library for a spooky trivia night! The trivia portion will include scary books, short stories, poetry, and some films. The reading involves picking an excerpt from a favorite scary book, poem, or short story. Attendees are encouraged to dress up in fun costumes to set the mood. A prize of a gift card will be awarded to the best costume. This event will be held over Zoom at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 29.

**Not So Haunted, Haunted Barn:** Saddle Club is hosting their ‘Haunted Barn’ again this year. However, it will look a bit different due to COVID-19 health restrictions. You will be able to meet the current campus horses, buy horseshoes, and visit the decorated stalls created by several other clubs on campus. This event will also be in partnership with the Office of Community Engagement for collecting non-perishable food items for the wider community. The Haunted Barn is taking place at the Saddle Club Barn from 3 p.m.-7 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 31.

**Movie on the Mall - Corpse Bride:** A classic Tim Burton film, (and one of my personal favorites), Corpse Bride, is being shown on the Mall from 8:15 p.m.-9:35 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 31.

**SCHS Halloween Double-Feature Fundraising Event:** The Stevens County Humane Society is putting on a double-feature Halloween event! The first event is a kid-friendly scavenger hunt, where the first 50 kids will receive a Halloween treats goodie bag. The second event is recommended for ages 13 and up, as it involves taking a walk through the Haunted Trails. The entrance fee for each event is $2, and masks, as well as following distancing protocols, will be required to attend. Both events are taking place at the Stevens County Humane Society, with the scavenger hunt going from 3:30 p.m.-4:30 p.m., and the Haunted Trails from 6 p.m.-9:30 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 30.

**24 Hour RPG Night:** RPG Club is having their 24 Hour RPG Night from Friday, Oct. 30 starting at 6 p.m. to Saturday, Oct. 31 ending at 3 p.m. The games will be held either online or in-person, (with a limited number of people allowed for in-person games). The in-person games will be held in the Humanities building with snacks and energy drinks provided. Check out the RPG Club Discord Server for more information!
