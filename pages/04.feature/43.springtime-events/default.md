With more and more people being vaccinated recently, a few blended/in-person events and programs have started to re-appear alongside online events. While the majority of programming is still happening virtually, there are some pandemic-friendly in-person events going on this month. Here are some in-person and virtual events available in April:

**Virtual Events**

• Faculty Recital: A Garden of Flowers: “Enjoy on YouTube this sequence of music inspired by wild and cultivated flowers by composers including Bliss, Reade, Debussy, Hamilton, Arne and Greaves. Featuring: Simon Tillier, clarinet; Ana Miller, soprano; Stephen Swanson, piano.” This event is taking place on Youtube on Saturday, April 10 at 7 p.m. The video link can be found on the UMM Events page for April 10.

• KUMM’s Kick Off to Vinylthon Concert: “Come and join KUMM for a live virtual concert over Zoom with three amazing local artists! Our first artist is Emily Kastrul who is the front woman for Sister Species:

	“Chamber pop from Minneapolis... with a lyrical approach both wry and tender” - Bandcamp ‘New & Notable” Accordionist and songwriter Emily Kastrul (Betazoid, Hazel Ra) has led chamber-pop septet Sister Species since 2011: a band known for their thoughtful, dynamic arrangements and opulent three-part trumpet harmonies. Kastrul’s intimate and intricate songwriting spans from bleak pop anthems about the inevitable heat death of the universe to drone songs about loss and cottonwood trees. Written with a gardener’s eye, Sister Species’ 2020 release “Light Exchanges” is full of acute & sensual observations about our daily lives & practices, from cutting onions to holding hammers to magnolias in bloom. Performing solo, Kastrul will share stripped-down versions of songs from Sister Species’ two most recent records as well as some new, unreleased works.
    
	Our second artist of the night is Cory Coffman! Cory Coffman is a Duluth, MN songwriter, arranger and multi-instrumentalist. Blending a bohemian-punk ethos with an indie-pop sound, Cory Coffman melds his inviting voice with a musical eclecticism, giving his songs popular appeal. Presenting poetic depth and musical thoughtfulness, Coffman is witty enough to laugh with, yet endearing enough to cry to. In his debut album, Coffman paints his place as an artist worth listening to. Canvas and Color is as much about hopeful new beginnings as it is the nostalgic past. With heartwarming lyrics and subtle satire, Coffman pairs simple chord progressions with sweet melodies that speak to the innocence in us all. Coffman has established himself as a prominent figure in the music scene of Duluth, Minnesota. His work as a freelance drummer and percussionist over the past decade has curated a diverse performance background. This variety of musical experiences can be heard in songs that feature a wide range of genres and a strong sense of rhythm. Cory Coffman is a standout musician who comforts his audience with his optimistic demeanor and affable nature. Canvas and Color brings a carefree attitude to an age of frustrated confusion.
    
	And our third and final artist will be a band called Coyote Kid. Coyote Kid is a Minneapolis based band. Their sound is dark and mysterious at its core. With layers upon layers of dynamic turns, from the hopeful highs of “Femme Fatale” to the guttural darkness of “Prowler’. Between Durry’s true grit voice, and Cassandra’s tender subtlety, you’ll find a vast array of narrative and stylistic possibilities. With imposing and wild jungle drums, soaring brass horns, growling bass, and shimmering spaghetti western guitars. This band has all of the tools it needs to paint an epic picture.” This event is taking place on Zoom on Friday, April 16 from 7 p.m. to 8:45 p.m.
    
• Vamos Juntos, Floating World, Sigma Delta Pi: Poetry Reading: “Please join us for an evening of beautiful poetry in multiple languages, read by fellow students and faculty!” This event will take place on Zoom on Wednesday, April 21 from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m.
