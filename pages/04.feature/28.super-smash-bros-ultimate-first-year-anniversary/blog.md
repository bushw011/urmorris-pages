On December 7, 2018, Nintendo Switch owners everywhere rejoiced as the latest entry in the “Super Smash Bros.” series, “Super Smash Bros. Ultimate “ (Special in Japan) released to the public. The world, of course, took notice: not only was it the fastest selling game on the Switch worldwide for eleven months, it also was the highest grossing entry in the series, surpassing the previous record holder, “Super Smash Bros. Brawl”, with 15.7 million copies sold as of September 2019. Fans and non-fans alike had to get their hands on it.

On Satuday, December 7, 2019, “Ultimate” celebrates its first anniversary. With more than 400 hours of playtime under my belt between two Switches, as well as helping reignite Morris’s very own Smash Club, I thought it would be fun to look back on “Ultimate” and get some opinions on how the game has grown over the year.

Teased during a Nintendo Direct presentation on March 8, 2018, Smash fans everywhere wondered what this new game would be. Many assumed it would be a simple port of “Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and 3DS” (abbreviated commonly as “Smash 4”), the previous entry in the series given that it had been less than a year since that game concluded development, though many suspected it would be a new game given the trailers’ inclusion of “Splatoon’s” Inklings, characters who were not featured in “Smash 4.”

Debate continued until E3 2018, where the game was officially unveiled by the game’s director, Masahiro Sakurai, as “Ultimate”, a new game being built on an expanded version of “Smash 4’s” engine. The big hook for “Ultimate”, aside from being on a new graphical engine, was that every fighter from every previous entry would return as a playable character. This ranged from the obvious veterans such as Mario, Captain Falcon, Link, Pikachu, and so on, but also the more unorthodox licensed characters such as Snake from “Metal Gear Solid”, Cloud from “Final Fantasy VII”, Ryu from “Street Fighter”, Sonic from “Sonic the Hedgehog,” and Bayonetta from “Bayonetta.” In addition, new characters were going to be added: the aforementioned Inklings, Ridley from “Metroid” (a heavily requested character and meme in the Smash community for being ‘too big for Smash’), King K. Rool from “Donkey Kong Country,” Ken from “Street Fighter,” and Simon and Richter Belmont from “Castlevania.” 

On top of all of this, over 100 stages and 800 music tracks were included from previous games. And, as a little cherry on top, Sakurai included a ‘story’ mode, World of Light, which was essentially an event battle single-player mode. This was truly going to be the ‘ultimate’ Smash Bros. game.

It didn’t stop there, however: during the last Nintendo Direct presentation surrounding “Ultimate” on November 1, 2018, Sakurai teased that there would be paid DLC for new characters, and that we should expect brand new characters that we had never seen before. The night before the game’s release, at The Game Awards 2018, Joker from “Persona 5” was revealed as the first of five DLC characters, stealing all press surrounding the game awards and shining a spotlight on “Ultimate.”

From there, the rest is history. After the game’s release, more characters were announced: the Hero from “Dragon Quest, Banjo & Kazooie from “Banjo & Kazooie,” and Terry Bogard from “Fatal Fury.” The final character has yet to be announced as of this article, but it is heavily rumored that they will be revealed at The Game Awards 2019.

“Ultimate” plays as a cross between “Melee” and “Smash 4,” which was already a cross between “Melee” and “Brawl.” The game currently boasts 74 characters, with more to be added in the future, meaning there is a gameplay style for everyone. You have your classic characters like Mario and Captain Falcon, who play a basic keep-away/rush-down game respectively, but you also have more unconventional characters: Cloud has a limit meter that lets him unleash a devastating super attack; Duck Hunt has multiple projectiles that need to be managed at the same time; Hero has MP for his attacks and a roulette wheel for surprise magic; Ryu and Terry can input commands from their home games to do more powerful versions of their standard attacks, so on and so forth.

Characters from previous games, who have not been seen since “Melee,” return with new and revamped movesets. Young Link is now a combo character; Pichu is a more aggressive, combo-oriented Pikachu; Snake has a cavalcade of explosives and ranged weaponry to play a keep-out game; Ice Climbers are still impossible to play, so on and so on. The sheer variety and nostalgia of the roster means no one will be without a character that they relate to in some way. And when in doubt, you can always play Kirby. Everyone loves Kirby!

While “Ultimate” does not have perfect balance—no fighting game does, anyway—it has the closest thing to perfect balance in the series next to “Melee.” While about half of “Melee’s” roster is competitively viable, “Brawl” has one character who dominated everything, and “Smash 4” changed with every new DLC character. So far, “Ultimate” has maintained impeccable balance, with seasoned players such as FOX|MkLeo, PG|ESAM, NRG|Nairo, TSM|Tweek, EU|Samsora, and PG|Marss all playing different characters and commenting on the diversity of the metagame. The current #1 “Ultimate” player in the world, MkLeo, has played several characters over the course of the game’s life: Ike, Cloud, Lucina, and most recently, earning him several wins and the Evolution (EVO) Grand Champion title, Joker. No one character stands head and shoulders over the other, aside from the joke characters who sit at the bottom (looking at you, Piranha Plant).

However, even casually, “Ultimate” remains a refined, chaotically fun experience. Maintaining the 8-player Smash mode from “Smash 4,” it has never been easier to get a big group of friends together to beat the ever-loving tar out of each other. With 100+ stages to choose from, and a bizarre assortment of items, from bombs to swords to Pokeballs and even Assist Trophies, every casual match threatens to be different from the last. Sakurai wanted to build the game to cater to both the competitive and the casual, family audiences. “Smash 4” was built with the casual audience in mind, so many competitive players felt the game was too homogenized at higher levels of play, calling it “the party game Smash so desperately wanted to be.” With “Ultimate,” Sakurai acknowledged that both parties have their reasons for playing. In an interview with Nintendo Insider, he stated: “fighting games have a lot of advanced players playing them, so it might seem a little intimidating. But fundamentally, this is a casual game, so I’d be grateful if people just had fun with it, without being scared. I’ve created the game with that intent.”

Starting late last year, I, and a small handful of other individuals, helped revive Morris’s very own Smash Club. A club that had started mostly playing “Smash 4” and “Melee,” now the club (almost exclusively) plays “Ultimate.” We meet every Friday, from 5 until whenever we get bored, and it has been one of the best experiences I have on this campus. 

“The experience varies from person to person,” Ethan, computer science major and Palutena main, told me. “I find [playing “Ultimate” at club] to be a lot of fun myself, but it really relies on if you have fun even without winning all the time.”

“I love feeling like I’m getting better at things, so playing Smash with people and seeing my skills improve with my characters is a great feeling,” Ihsan, English major and Incineroar main, told me. It has been a phenomenal time watching everyone improve with their respective characters, or pick up a new one and go “wow, that is awesome!” every single time.

There is a definite chill vibe at Smash club. Nobody ever comes angry or frustrated with life; all that gets left at the door. People instead sit down, have a drink, eat some snacks, and prepare mentally to play chaotic 8-player matches and more focused one-on-ones. While we do certainly get our fair share of salt (especially when there are eight Duck Hunts on the field—trust me, you’ve never felt irritation like that before) there is never any malice. It is all in good fun! Many of us did not know each other at the start of this year, but that is honestly the way to play.

Sakurai even said in the same interview with NI: “I think the best way to start is, if possible, to get together with some friends rather than diving headfirst into online matches. I think everybody has a community and a playstyle that best suits them. When you boil it down, this game can provide a place for players to showcase some really advanced gameplay as a fighting game, but there’s also plenty of ways to enjoy it as a casual game. I hope everybody can enjoy playing this game the way they want.”

There you have it. Find your buddies, crack open and celebrate an entire year of what is my personal Game of the Year.
