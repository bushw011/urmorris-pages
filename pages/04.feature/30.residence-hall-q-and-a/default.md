Returning to campus next year? Unsure of what hall to choose? Need one final push? Not to worry, friends! This article is for YOU. With brief overviews and testimonials from the hall directors of each hall, this guide should (hopefully) assist in helping you choose which hall is right for you!

**Blakely:** Built in 1920 as the senior dormitory for the West Central School of Agriculture, Blakely is the smallest residence hall on campus, able to support around 50 students between two gender-inclusive floors. Each room, presented as “double-as-single” rooms provide a spacious environment for students to live. In 2020, Blakely also received renovations to include classrooms on the ground floor, giving Blakely a distinctly educational vibe.

**Katarina Wilke, HD of Blakely:**

“Personally, there are three main things that I really like about Blakely Hall. First, the location of Blakely is very convenient; it’s really not too far from anything on campus. Second, Blakely has an elevator, which makes moving-in relatively easy. Finally, the rooms in Blakely are pretty spacious, and they have nice, high ceilings. P.S. We also have the best custodian; shout out to Connie! 

The rooms are generally only sold as “double-as-a-single” rooms, so they are a little expensive. Additionally, there are no carpets in any of the rooms, which, for me, is not ideal. Students should also be aware that there are now classrooms on the bottom floor of Blakely, so there are many “non-residents” who are in and out of Blakely throughout the day. 

I think Blakely is unique in that it offers a kind of balance between living by yourself and living in a community. Residents have the convenience and privacy of having their own rooms, but they still share community spaces and have opportunities for engaging in, and being part of the hall community via programs and community events. I really love the uniqueness and diversity of our Blakely residents. Our residents have a great variety of backgrounds, interests, and skills, which I think is awesome! 

I think Blakely is a really great hall for upperclassmen. It has many convenient features, and it provides a good balance between living independently and living in a community.”

**Spooner:** Named after Louis C. Spooner, a local state representative in the 1913, Spooner houses four floors of students: two women-only floors, one man-only, one co-ed. The rustic look definitely sells Spooner as a cozy, communal space for upperclassmen. The Spooner lounge features arched windows that, when the sun is shining just right, cascade brilliantly into the lounge. Its most recent refurbishing was in 1993, giving students a wonderful, comfortable atmosphere for students to live.

**Melissa Voss, HD of Spooner:**

“I find that Spooner has this calm and collected nature where you have a tight-knit group of friends while also being a quiet place to live, study, or just relax. 

The only real problem is it’s an old building; we have so many maintenance issues! Specifically with the laundry. It’s an old building so you have to put that into consideration as well. 

The design of the main floor, especially with the veranda! I like to describe it as a nice mix of Hogwarts and Harvard due to its dark wood. Makes a wonderful place to study. Everyone is respectful! Whether it is to me, the CAs, or other residents, everyone is willing to make this place a space where people feel safe and welcome. We care about one another here. Just like any hall, you build a community with your floor but here you build a family; a laid-back, chill family. 

Regardless, my overall advice would be to explore your living situation options and work with what is best for you! And apply early!”

**Green Prairie:** Built in 2013 as a sustainable model of housing, Green Prairie is the epitome of Morris’ models of sustainability. Built and maintained with many accessible and sustainable features, such as insulated concrete forms (ICFs) to help sustain heat in winter, low-flow plumbing fixtures, and aesthetically, a lovely garden out front. Able to house 72 students, each room offers suite-style housing for groups.

Anika Paulson, HD of Green Prairie:

“I think living in a community designed to be committed to sustainability is the biggest draw to Green Prairie. Our building LEAD certified, the programming that our staff does highlights morris’s mission of environmental awareness and stewardship, and choosing GP is choosing to be a part of a community where you can be a part of that mission. If you want to be more eco-friendly, it’s a great place to live to develop green habits with inspiration and help from your neighbors. 

The worst part about GP is the cost. It’s the most expensive place to live on campus, but with that added cost, you are paying for suite style living and the added amenities of the youngest building on campus. You share a bathroom with only your Suite, you have complete control over the temperature in your space, and it’s the most accessible building on campus. Depending on the floor, you can choose to live in a designated single (within a suite with 4 bedrooms) without the added cost you would pay in a different residence hall. 

Some people say GP is too far away from things, but I see that as a perk. Depending on the room, we have the best views on campus, overlooking the gardens, wind turbines, and the horse pasture. It might be further from the epicenter of campus than any other hall, but UMM is small, it only takes a couple minutes to cross the entire campus. 

Green Prairie is the only hall on campus that has both freshmen and upperclassmen floors. This unique combination gives the hall a great balance between the energy of freshman and wisdom of upperclassmen, benefiting all in the process.”

**The Apartments:** Comprised of four separate buildings, each with eighteen apartments, the apartments provide a community for students who want to live in groups or in a more “traditional” living space. Each apartment has a living room with a kitchenette, and a bathroom. The community building, known by residents as “The  Cube,” provides a laundry room and a small community area for students to relax and watch TV.

**Parker Smith, HD of the Apartments:**

“I think that the best thing about the apartments is the space and the learning opportunities that come with it. Living in the on-campus apartments allows our students to have the independence and responsibility of an apartment, but not sacrifice the convenience and support of living on campus. We are also the only on campus area where students are not required to have a meal plan. For many, the apartments are a chance to develop the knowledge and skill to live off campus, whether that be in later years at Morris, or after graduation. The community in the apartments is different from the residence halls, less like a dorm floor and more like a neighborhood. Everyone has their privacy, but there is also a friendly sense of community. I don’t think I really have a part that I dislike, its just a really nice place to live. I hope that helps, good luck!”
